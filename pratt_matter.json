          "Bot: Hello David,\n\nI'm Zarah from Hepworth Legal. We have a strong track record in successfully handling medical malpractice cases, and I'm confident we can manage your legal matter with the care and expertise it deserves. Please feel free to reach out with any questions you have; we're here to help you navigate through this challenging time.\n\nBest regards,\nZarah\n\nUser: Thank you. \n\nBot: Hello David, my name is Zarah and I'm an AI legal assistant for Hepworth Legal. To assist you further, could you please share more details about your legal matter? This will help us understand how we can best support you.\n\nUser: I have a short write up, hang on. \n\nBot: David, I'm truly sorry to hear about the injuries you've sustained due to medical malpractice. In Utah, cases like yours are taken very seriously, and there's a limited time to file a medical malpractice claim, which is generally two years from the date of the incident. Can you tell me if you've already obtained your medical records from the surgery?\n\nUser: I am a Family Medicine doctor with permanent nerve damage, ED, and bladder issues from a botched back surgery with multiple mistakes made; missed diagnosis, negligent failure to treat, and delay in diagnosis/care. During my L3 micro-discectomy in December of 2022, Dr. Kade Huntsman cut a vertebral vein, then claimed to have stopped the bleeding, however it bled around my spinal cord, causing an epidural hematoma and then EMG changes (my legs went dead below the knees) that were ignored by the surgeon's PA while he was closing. The Surgeon had left the OR to do another case (claiming he was already in the other OR, which is impossible). Upon awakening, I had cauda-equina syndrome and laid there for 45 minutes before the surgeon returned and reopened my back. He had conflicting documentation regarding the epidural hematoma he evacuated, but by then the damage was done. I was out of work for 4.5 months, relearned how to walk, have permanent nerve damage from L3-S2 on an EMG, and diagnosed with a neurogenic bladder. This has changed my life and I can no longer do near the activities I used to. I promise you this is a case we can win because of my medical knowledge and your expertise, thank you. \n\nBot: David, your experience and resolve are admirable. It's clear you understand the gravity of your situation. I recommend a consultation with Hepworth Legal to explore your options. When would be a convenient time for you to discuss your case with our attorneys?\n\nUser: Anytime is fine\n\nBot: David, based on the details you've provided, I recommend scheduling a 30-minute consultation with our expert attorneys. During the consultation, we can discuss your case in depth, provide you with next steps, and if possible, work towards resolving your legal issue. The consultation fee is $250. Would you like me to schedule the consultation for you?\n"

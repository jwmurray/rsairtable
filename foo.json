        "Clio Consultation Notes": "This appears to be a lengthy transcript of a conversation between Suzanne Fox and two attorneys, Steven Littlefield and Andrew Rawlings. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\nSuzanne Fox and her daughter Julianne Dattweiler created a detailed map of Mayan ruins in Central America called the \"Mayan Trail Map\" over the course of 30 years, with Suzanne taking photographs and providing content while Julianne handled the business aspects. They published the map in 2008 under a company called \"Easy Go Guides.\"\n\nRecently, Julianne and her husband Kurt have tried to take control of the map and company behind Suzanne's back. They made minor changes to the map, claimed copyright ownership, and Kurt threatened Suzanne with a cease and desist to stop her from republishing or selling the map. \n\nSuzanne believes Julianne and Kurt are doing this because they are in financial trouble and need assets. She wants to stop them from wrongfully taking credit for her life's work.\n\nThe attorneys advise that the changes Julianne made do not constitute a real \"update\" that would give her ownership. They say Julianne is likely misappropriating Suzanne's intellectual property. \n\nThey recommend Suzanne mail a copy of the original map to herself (poor man's copyright), write a letter to Julianne and Kurt demanding they cease and desist since she is the rightful owner, and ask for proof if they claim to have copyrighted it themselves. \n\nHiring the law firm to handle this would cost $3000-4000, which Suzanne cannot afford, so they advise her on how to take initial steps herself. Overall, the attorneys believe Suzanne has a strong case that this is her intellectual property that Julianne and Kurt are wrongfully trying to appropriate.\n",

          "Bot: This is Hepworth Legal. We received your request to learn more about our services. Before we get started, may we please have your name?\n\nUser @ 6/1/2024 17:3:9\nAnthony\n\nBot @ 6/1/2024 17:3:39\nHello Anthony, my name is Zarah and I am an AI legal assistant for Hepworth Legal. Thank you for reaching out to us. To better assist you, could you please provide more details about the legal issue you're facing? For instance, what type of legal matter is it (e.g., family law, business, personal injury), and when did the event or situation occur? Additionally, are there any specific concerns or questions you have at this stage that you would like us to address?\n\nUser @ 6/1/2024 17:7:46\nI have a friend of a friend renting my home. It was under renovation when we met and they needed a place so we renovated it enough for them to move in. There is an outdoor stairwell with one railing on one side but missing on the other side, a potential hazard. There is also the main power line coming to the home 6 feet above the deck, within reach if not careful. Can I write the lease agreement in a way that states renter moved in knowing the condition and that they need to be careful and responsible for themselves?\n\nBot @ 6/1/2024 17:8:19\nHello Anthony, I understand your concern about ensuring the safety of your property and the well-being of your tenants. In Utah, lease agreements can include clauses that address the condition of the property and the tenant's acknowledgment of such, which can be crucial for liability reasons. Could you tell me if there have been any incidents or concerns raised by the tenant regarding the stairwell or power line since they moved in?\n\nUser @ 6/1/2024 17:11:59\nNo incidents. The tenant and I both identified the stairwell and the power line as something that could be a safety issue. Is this something I need to fix by law or regulation, or can it remain that way as it is an old house and it appears to have always been that way. \n\nBot @ 6/1/2024 17:12:19\nHi Anthony, it's good to hear there have been no incidents. Addressing potential hazards like the stairwell and power line is important. To ensure compliance with Utah regulations and protect yourself legally, I recommend scheduling a consultation with Hepworth Legal. Would you be interested in setting up a time to discuss this further?\n\nUser @ 6/1/2024 17:21:16\nNot yet. I will call back during the week and go from there. Thank you. \n\nBot @ 6/1/2024 17:21:41\nThank you for letting me know, Anthony. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!\nBot: Michael Hepworth here, thank you for consulting with us today.

Mediation with UPD has been used when necessary.\n\\- The attorney advised getting a survey done first before taking any legal action, to clearly establish the property line. Filing a lawsuit could result in high costs that may not be recoverable.\n\\- Moving forward, the client will get a survey and reevaluate their options once the property line has been established.

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "# $350 In-Office Consult - Keith Mills\nKeith Mills, terminated by Barnes Aerospace on December 23, discussed his concerns with attorney Chris Binning. Keith's termination letter offered two severance options, with the second (B) potentially waiving all claims. Keith highlighted the company's legal obligation to have a quality manager, which was not replaced. He mentioned Diane Countryman, an auditor who complained about him, and the HR manager's hostility. Keith's performance included passing an FAA audit with no findings. Chris advised against signing the termination letter and suggested filing a claim with the Utah Anti-Discrimination Labor Division or the EEOC, citing potential wrongful termination and discrimination.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/aorCd46VqHEDeGUlThYUBssXeFY?view=transcript>\n## Action Items\n- [ ] @Chris Binning - Evaluate the potential for a wrongful termination claim based on the presented information.\n- [ ] @Chris Binning - Provide the retainer agreement for potential representation in the EEOC or UALD claim.\n- [ ] Review the termination letter and severance package details.\n- [ ] Discuss the timeline of events and issues with Diane Countryman.\n- [ ] Monitor for the job posting being re-listed at Barnes Aerospace.\n- [ ] Decide on timing for filing the EEOC or UALD claim, likely waiting 90 days.\n## Outline\n### Termination Details and Initial Concerns\n- Chris Binning introduces himself as one of the attorneys and establishes attorney-client privilege.\n- Keith Mills explains his termination from Barnes Aerospace on September 23, coinciding with the termination of his severance options.\n- Keith presents a termination letter with two scenarios: A offers two weeks' severance, B offers three weeks' severance, with B eliminating all claims.\n- Keith expresses discomfort with signing either option due to the broad waiver in B, which includes a release from all claims.\n### Quality Manager Role and Contractual Obligations\n- Keith highlights the problematic nature of Barnes Aerospace not having a quality manager, which is legally required for their QMS system and military contracts.\n- Chris Binning and Keith discuss the company's history of terminating positions under the guise of elimination, only to repost them shortly after.\n- Keith points out that the company had previously reposted similar positions within three weeks of termination.\n- Keith emphasizes the severity of the situation, particularly the addendum in the termination letter that could potentially waive all claims.\n### HR Issues and Employee Complaints\n- Keith describes the HR manager's apparent hostility towards him, despite his efforts to improve the company's quality management.\n- Keith mentions an employee, Diane Countryman, who was not performing her auditing duties and had a history of complaints.\n- Keith explains that Diane had influenced the register to give the company a major finding, which he believed was unethical.\n- Keith recounts a meeting with HR where he was degraded and not allowed to speak, while Diane was fully supported.\n### Discrimination and Hostile Work Environment\n- Keith details the hostile work environment created by the HR manager and Diane, leading to his stress and medication.\n- Keith mentions that he was punished for speaking out against discrimination and received no support from upper management.\n- Keith describes the general manager and quality director's support for him, but their inability to provide effective help.\n- Keith outlines the emotional and financial toll of his termination, including lost wages, medical expenses, and the impact on his family.\n### Legal Considerations and Potential Claims\n- Chris Binning advises Keith not to sign the termination letter to preserve any potential claims.\n- Chris identifies potential issues of pretextual termination, discrimination, and retaliation, suggesting involvement from the Utah Anti-Discrimination Labor Division or the EEOC.\n- Chris highlights the importance of the company's contractual obligations and the implications for federal contracts.\n- Chris and Keith discuss the possibility of filing a claim with the EEOC or the Utah Labor Division, considering the company's history of similar terminations.\n### Next Steps and Evidence Gathering\n- Chris Binning explains the process of filing a claim with the EEOC or the Utah Labor Division and the potential timeline for action.\n- Keith and Chris discuss the importance of gathering evidence, including the reposting of the quality manager position and any new job offers Keith receives.\n- Chris advises Keith to keep a copy of the termination letter and any relevant documents, as the company may attempt to destroy evidence.\n- Chris outlines the potential costs and benefits of pursuing a legal claim, emphasizing the importance of documenting the timeline and supporting evidence.\n### Retainer Agreement and Legal Representation\n- Chris Binning provides details about the retainer agreement for legal representation, including the hourly billing structure and the consensual attorney lien.\n- Keith and Chris discuss the possibility of retaining Chris's services and the next steps for filing a claim.\n- Chris advises Keith to wait for the company to repost the quality manager position or for Keith to secure a new job before proceeding with legal action.\n- Chris reassures Keith that he will provide support and guidance throughout the process, including assistance with document submission and potential mediation.\n### Final Considerations and Emotional Impact\n- Keith expresses his desire to prevent the company from wrongfully terminating others and to hold them accountable for their actions.\n- Chris acknowledges the emotional impact of the situation and the importance of standing up against workplace injustice.\n- Keith and Chris discuss the potential challenges of gathering evidence and the importance of maintaining a strong case.\n- Chris emphasizes the need for patience and strategic planning, considering the company's history and potential legal strategies.\n\n",

        "Clio Matter Details": "employment (Ogden) - see notes below - term. letter needs to be reviewed w/ 23days from 23 Dec (15Jan'25)\n--\nI was terminated from my employer Barnes Aerospace wrongfully for the following reasons: I’m an aerospace quality manager making $127k\n1. My position was eliminated and legally cannot be. I am the quality manager for Barnes Aerospace located in Ogden Utah. In the aerospace world, it is a requirement to have a quality manager in place (see AS9100D section 5.3) in order to remain certified to AS9100 Rev D and contractually with our contracts. We deal with both commercial and military contracts and it is a requirement to have a quality manager in place to conform to AS9100 quality management system requirements and customer contracts. You cannot eliminate a quality manager position. There is no one to drive the QMS as a leader. Barnes Aerospace procedures QI-001 requires a quality manager to ensure that the quality management system conforms to the requirements of the AS9100 Rev D Standard and per customer contracts.\n2. I was let go because Barnes Aerospace was afraid of a lawsuit from a lady who worked for me. Barnes figured that letting me go and eliminating my position was the easier way out to avoid a lawsuit. She took 7 different people to HR for numerous reasons and I was just 1 of 7 in the last year.\n3. I was told by HR,  the General manager, and the Quality director that she is trouble and will sue us for $6 figures. She openly admitted to being fired from her last 2 jobs. \n4. I was wrongfully terminated as a Protected Class because I’m 53 years old male, per Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\n5. Direct Discrimination, The HR manager said I could not file a discrimination case against her. The HR manager hates men in general. I asked why and received no answer. The HR manager just said you just can't. I was punished for speaking out against the discrimination question.\n6. The HR manager also does not like men, I can prove that when you are ready and ask. When I hire quality engineers the HR manager always gives a woman more money than a man. Even if she does not have as much experience or education. Note: the last quality engineer I hired was a woman. She is amazing and I was very grateful to have her on my team.\n7. I was the only person that the HR manager would attend the interviews I performed when hiring my team. WHY?\n8. Harassment and a hostile environment. With all the issues, and the hostile environment of the situation, this created a very stressful situation and environment for me at work. I ended up on medication to cope. The medication is, Lexapro. Escitalopram to treat my anxiety and stress caused by this situation, along with Trazodone to help me get to sleep at night. This was prescribed to me on 10/20/2024 by Dr, Sierra Mayzsak\n9. My wife works at Barnes Aerospace in Ogden Utah as well, and I'm afraid of retaliation and a stressful environment for her as well.\n10. Now that my job has been terminated, I will incur, Lost wages, lost medical, lost Benefits, Medical Expenses, Cost of Job Searches, Lost of Emotional Distress, Possible Attorney Fees and more.\n11. In the company published handbook, the employer has a legal duty to not terminate an employee as long as he or she is complying with the guidelines in the handbook. In such cases, the employee handbook serves as the implied contract of employment. I violated nothing in the employee handbook and have never received a verbal or written warning for anything.\n12. Constructive discharge: Since I did not voluntarily resign, he is considered terminated. This situation occurs when an employer deliberately changes an employee's working conditions and work environment to make it intolerable for him or her to continue. \n\n1. Aerospace companies seek AS9100 certification, which outlines the need for a robust quality management system and a designated quality manager to oversee it.\n2. On November 19th I set up a meeting to talk with my General Manager and Quality Director about stepping down because of this issue. It is causing me great distress and I feel I have no support from upper management to help deal with this issue. They both said not to step down, and I have their full support. Well work through this issue together. I was let go on December 23, 2024.\n\nanswer: prev. employment matter & termination letter review\nquestion: Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting.\n\nanswer: Barnes Aerospace\nquestion: We need to clear any potential conflicts of interest. Please tell us the names of all parties who may be involved in your legal matter.\nConsult Type:\n60 Minute Consultation\nConsult Time:\n03:30pm - Monday, January 6, 2025\nConsult Location\nBountiful Office\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Michael Hepworth met with Karen, Don and Bailey to discuss issues they were facing at their workplace under the general manager Cameron and regional director Chris. Karen described a history of ageism, targeting of employees, and unaddressed concerns about leadership and treatment of staff. Most recently, Karen was accused of false allegations in a meeting with HR and Chris.\n\nThey discussed applicable employment law and protections, but Michael determined the treatment did not clearly violate those based on protected attributes. He cautioned against personal attacks if the employees chose to address the owners or take further action. Michael suggested sending a respectful letter to owners Carter and Grayson outlining specific examples of issues, toxic culture and lack of leadership, while focusing on potential solutions rather than problems.\n",

        "Clio Matter Details": "I got a letter this week from Panther investigations and security saying they are investigating me for stalking and harassment. It is a very long story but I will try to summarize here what I can. I was having an affair with a man (only through text) for a few months. We text each other all day every day for 2 months. My husband found out and called his number, the only thing he said is I think I missed a call from here, he said nope and they hung up. Anyways the guy said per his company policy he had to change his number. About a week later I found an ad he placed online with his new number and an email.  In the last 2 months I sent him 4 emails and called 4 times. He never answered or replied so I gave up but I guess just from those contacts he hired this company. He never told me to stop contacting him &amp; I had no idea he was taking it this way. He had told me before to get a burner phone and call him from that, he even suggested he would get one.  I honestly think maybe he was married and filed it to save face. I don't even know his real name, where he lives, or where he works. It's pretty hard to stalk someone when you really know nothing about them and none of the contact was negative in nature. He asked for the PI to keep his info confidential too.  I obviously have ceased all communication but I'm not sure if they will still try to file something on me. Do you think I should get an attorney now or wait and see if they even move this forward. Also he had the letter sent to my work so I feel like he is trying to destroy me and my reputation now. \n\nanswer: I got a letter this week from Panther investigations and security saying they are investigating me for stalking and harassment.

He explained his firm's $4,000 retainer fee but said he would review the documents without a retainer first. \n\nThey discussed options like negotiating with the complex, pursuing the ex-boyfriend, or legal action if the lawyer mother misrepresented notifying Rachel. Chris provided tips for communicating with the complex and avoiding a potential debt collection lawsuit.\n",

Critical Moments Analysis\nKey turning point: Reframing from emotional reaction to strategic asset preservation. Quote: \"You sell it, you take that cash, I promise you, you will blow that cash on stupid shit, and you'll be so mad in 20 years looking back.\"\n\n4.

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Warren has seen combat in Iraq - 2003. PTSD and tinnitus. Headaches and migraines. Channels the symptoms, which include aggression, into physical activity. Any explosions or loud noises can trigger. Time off does wonders for health. Warren enjoys winter sports in particular.\n\nHR told Warren to recertify his FMLA. Warren doesn't know whether employer has made any allegations of fraud to the DOL. This is the second time boss has tried to fire Warren. \n\nBackCountry.com is like REI. Online retailer that sells sporting equipment. Warren has been there eight years. Warren does sales - has a book of business. Works with rich people who like to go into the back country.\n\nThings are not good between Warren and his boss right now. Samuel Mason. Gear closet - employees can check out gear. Samuel has accused Warren of taking things out of the closet. Warren has never done that. \n\nSamuel has given Warren a written warning - a few people were fired. There was always a paid lunch, and then one day they decided that was \"stolen\" time for not clocking out. Warren survived that by bringing up his disability. \"We've decided to part ways with you and keep you.\" ??? Warren didn't get fired.\n\nHR is Sean Craig - he's the one who called Warren to accuse him of fraud. 801-736-6155. \n\nJennie explained FMLA law to Warren, along with the laws governing disability discrimination and workplace harassment. Warren started to get agitated and disclosed that he has started drinking due to anxiety. He has also been calling in sick because he doesn't feel that he can safely be around Samuel. After 30 minutes of the consult time, Warren decided to retain for assistance in determining whether the employer can be educated to the point that Warren can use his FMLA lease as needed to get away from workplace stress when his PTSD flares. Jennie used the last 30 minutes of the consult time to leave a VM for Sean Craig and to write him a follow-up email. scraig@backcountry.com\n",

George's will named Dave as the personal representative, and he had four siblings: Elizabeth, Mark, and Tricia. George's mental capacity declined, leading to the transfer of his house to his sister-in-law Becky for $1 to avoid IRS issues. The house is valued at $300,000, and George had $4,000 in savings.

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "The meeting involved a landlord and her interpreter discussing a tenant eviction case. The tenant, who claims her daughter is sick due to mold in the property, has already consulted with a non-attorney practitioner who charged $500 but couldn't resolve the issue. The landlord is seeking new legal representation and is willing to pay $7,500 as a retainer, with hourly rates of $300 for Caleb and $325 for Ryan. The landlord is also considering additional testing for mold. The lawyers emphasized the importance of preparing for hearings and negotiating simultaneously. The landlord needs to decide quickly due to impending deadlines.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/-2FEi6obyCjG73P6vQifxww7eG0?view=transcript>\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Review the retainer agreement and decide whether to hire the law firm.\n- [ ] If the landlord decides to hire the law firm, schedule a follow-up meeting on Monday to sign the retainer agreement and provide any additional documents.\n- [ ] If the landlord hires the law firm, submit the required disclosure or exhibit for the upcoming hearing.\n- [ ] Negotiate with the opposing party to try to settle the case out of court.\n## Outline\n### Confidentiality and Introduction\n- Ryan Nelson emphasizes the importance of starting with confidentiality agreements and recording the meeting for note-taking purposes.\n- Caleb Marshall explains the attorney-client privilege and its limitations due to the presence of the interpreter.\n- Ryan Nelson clarifies that anything said in the room is not confidential between the interpreter and the client.\n- Speaker 3 expresses discomfort about potential legal implications and the risk of being asked to testify.\n### Client's Background and Case Details\n- Speaker 3 explains that she is a landlord with a tenant who is trying to claim medical expenses due to mold in the property.\n- The tenant claims that her daughter got sick from mold, but the landlord has pictures to prove there is no mold.\n- The tenant is accused of causing property damage and is now seeking money for medical bills.\n- The landlord has already consulted with a non-attorney practitioner named Jesse, who charged $500 but could not resolve the issue.\n### Current Legal Situation and Needs\n- The landlord is desperate to find new legal representation and has documents ready for submission, including a disclosure.\n- The landlord is asking for $5,700 to $8,600 and wants the case to be settled without going to court.\n- The tenant's side is claiming damages, but the landlord insists she does not owe anyone money.\n- Ryan Nelson advises the landlord to hire them and suggests moving deadlines to include all necessary exhibits and witnesses.\n### Retainer Agreement and Costs\n- Caleb Marshall explains the retainer process, which involves an initial payment of $7,500, followed by hourly billing.\n- The landlord expresses concern about the cost and needs time to think about it.\n- Ryan Nelson reassures the landlord that if they win the case, attorney fees could be awarded, making the cost more manageable.\n- The landlord is considering other attorneys but acknowledges the urgency of the situation.\n### Next Steps and Appointment\n- Ryan Nelson and Caleb Marshall discuss the importance of preparing for hearings while also negotiating with the opposing counsel.\n- The landlord agrees to think about hiring them and will decide by Monday.\n- An appointment is scheduled for Monday to finalize the retainer agreement and discuss further steps.\n- The landlord will bring additional documents and decide whether to sign the retainer agreement in person or online.\n\n",

Despite paying rent and complying with park rules, the property manager issued a five-day eviction notice. Mickey's mother, who owned the home, recently passed away, and the title was transferred to Mickey, her sister, and her son. Mickey has submitted multiple applications and offered a $1,000 deposit but was told trapping cats was more important. The lawyers advise Mickey to request a resolution meeting, get the property deed recorded, and possibly seek legal aid. They also suggest using her son's disability status to negotiate more time.\n## Action Items\n- [ ] @Steven Littlefield - Explore options for extending the time to vacate the home, such as citing the

again, including a copy of the title and her son's disability statement.\n- The property manager issued a five-day notice to vacate, which Mickey received yesterday.\n### Legal and Statutory

recommended steps.\n\n",

Consultation Overview\nThe consultation centered on a mobile home park eviction matter involving complex family dynamics, disability considerations, and property ownership issues. The flow was largely client-driven, with attorneys primarily reactive rather than proactive. Key discussion points included property ownership transfer, disability rights, and resolution options. Critical moments included the identification of the son's disability status as a potential legal leverage point and the late introduction of fees.\n\n2. Attorney Performance Analysis\n\nExpertise Demonstration (Score: 82/100)\nThe attorneys demonstrated solid knowledge of mobile home park statutes and eviction procedures. Notable quote showing expertise:\n\"Under the statute, they're very strictly enforced... you can request a meeting to attempt resolution of the disputes... that has to happen within two days.\"\n\nSales Technique Evaluation (Score: 65/100)\nThe consultation lacked structured need discovery and early value proposition presentation. The attorneys allowed the client to control the narrative without strategic direction. The fee discussion was delayed until the end and presented without proper value building:\n\"We typically charge a $7,500 retainer... Oh wow\" (client's reaction indicating price shock)\n\nProfessional Presence (Score: 75/100)\nThe attorneys maintained professional composure but could have shown more assertive guidance. Communication was clear but often reactive rather than proactive.\n\n3. Critical Moments Analysis\nMissed Opportunities:\n- Early establishment of attorney-client relationship value\n- Strategic use of son's disability status as leverage\n- Proactive discussion of representation benefits\n- Earlier fee discussion integrated with value proposition\n\n4. Improvement Recommendations\n- Implement structured consultation framework\n- Develop stronger value proposition presentation\n- Move fee discussion earlier in consultation\n- Enhance active listening with strategic direction\n- Create clear decision points throughout consultation\n- Develop stronger closing techniques\n\n5. Comparative Analysis\nThe consultation fell below industry standards for structured legal consultations, particularly in sales technique and consultation control. The technical legal advice was sound but not effectively leveraged for client retention.\n\nThe final grade of C (74%) reflects strong legal knowledge counterbalanced by significant weaknesses in sales technique and consultation structure. The non-retention outcome appears primarily due to poor value proposition development and late fee introduction rather than legal expertise deficiencies."

The possibility of a repair service is also discussed.",

          "value": "# CONSULTATION ANALYSIS REPORT\n\n## Executive Summary:\n- Date and Time of Consultation: July 7, 2025\n- Participants: Xiaoxin Chen (client), Caleb Marshall (attorney), Emily (associate attorney)\n- Final Grade: B\n- Overall Score: 85%\n- Retention Status: Not Retained (but potential future business identified)\n- Quick-view strengths: Strong legal knowledge, good rapport building, effective explanation of complex concepts\n- Quick-view weaknesses: Missed opportunity for immediate retention, limited value proposition for services, unclear follow-up process\n\n## Detailed Analysis:\n\n### 1. Consultation Overview\nThe consultation involved a landlord (Xiaoxin) seeking advice on a security deposit dispute with former tenants. The attorney effectively established rapport and gathered comprehensive information about the dispute, which centered on cleaning fees, carpet replacement, and normal wear and tear definitions. The consultation flowed logically from problem identification to legal analysis and recommendations. Critical moments included the discussion of what constitutes normal wear and tear, the explanation of burden of proof in small claims court, and the identification of future contract review needs. The attorney provided practical advice while identifying a potential future business opportunity for contract review services.\n\n### 2. Attorney Performance Analysis\n\n#### Expertise Demonstration (Score: 88%)\nThe attorney demonstrated strong knowledge of landlord-tenant law, particularly regarding security deposits and wear and tear standards. When explaining normal wear and tear, he stated: \"One of the big things that they've said that are consistently considered wear and tear...is things like nail holes in walls and little bits of painting.\" He effectively explained legal concepts in accessible language and provided nuanced analysis of the client's situation, noting that \"it's very fact dependent\" and explaining how courts evaluate reasonableness.\n\n#### Sales Technique Evaluation (Score: 78%)\nThe attorney built good rapport but missed opportunities to convert immediate interest into a retention. When the client asked about contract review services, the attorney provided options without a strong value proposition: \"You could schedule another consultation like this. Or if you want an extensive deep dive redrafting of everything, that could be a separate retainer where it might be something we charge.\" The associate attorney provided stronger value framing by asking: \"Would you rather go to a small particular client and spend 3 to $500 or use that money and pay the firm to kind of wrap you up a little tighter of a contract?\"\n\n#### Professional Presence Assessment (Score: 87%)\nThe attorney maintained a confident, professional demeanor throughout the consultation. His communication was clear and articulate, and he effectively managed the conversation flow. He demonstrated appropriate empathy when acknowledging the client's frustration: \"Yeah. You're good. And that actually really helps in kind of my answer.\" The attorney allowed the client to fully express concerns without interruption, showing strong listening skills.\n\n#### Client Engagement Analysis (Score: 86%)\nThe attorney maintained strong client engagement throughout the consultation. He confirmed understanding through paraphrasing and follow-up questions. The client remained highly engaged, asking clarifying questions and expressing appreciation: \"That makes a lot more sense.\" The attorney effectively addressed the client's emotional concerns about tenant behavior while keeping the focus on practical legal solutions.\n\n### 3. Critical Moments Analysis\nA key turning point occurred when the client revealed interest in contract review services: \"Maybe we will book another consultation, and we can start with review first.\" The attorney provided options but missed the opportunity to secure immediate commitment. The associate attorney effectively stepped in to strengthen the value proposition by framing the contract review as an investment rather than an expense. Another critical moment was when the attorney advised against admitting fault in communications with tenants: \"Don't admit anything outright. Don't say, yes. That's totally my fault,\" providing practical guidance beyond the immediate legal question.\n\n### 4. Retention Analysis\nWhile no immediate retention occurred, the consultation laid groundwork for future business. The client expressed clear interest in contract review services: \"I definitely do...directly reach out to your firm to make appointment for my contract?\" The attorney could have secured commitment by offering specific next steps rather than asking: \"Do you want us to have our receptionist reach out to you to schedule an appointment?\" The pricing mention (\"$3,000 retainer\") without clear value articulation may have contributed to the lack of immediate commitment, though the client remained interested in future services.\n\n### 5. Improvement Recommendations\n1. Develop a clearer value proposition for contract review services, emphasizing ROI and risk reduction\n2. Create a more structured closing process with specific next steps rather than open-ended options\n3. Prepare pricing packages for common landlord services to present confidently\n4. Implement immediate follow-up scheduling during the consultation rather than deferring to reception\n5. Develop educational materials specific to landlord-tenant issues to provide as value-adds\n6. Practice transitioning from advisory mode to business development mode more seamlessly\n\n### 6. Comparative Analysis\nThe consultation demonstrated stronger legal expertise than sales execution. While the attorney provided sound legal advice, the business development aspect lacked the structure and assertiveness seen in high-performing consultations. The associate attorney demonstrated best practices by reframing the contract review as an investment rather than an expense. The consultation successfully identified client needs but fell short in converting interest to commitment, a common challenge in legal consultations."

Recommended by Thomas wood to your firm\n\nName: Xiaoxin Chen\nEmail: xiao\\_c@yahoo.com\nEvent Type: 30 Minute Consultation\nEvent Location: \nEvent Date: 1:30pm - Monday, July 7, 2025\n\nQuestions & Answers From Calendly:\nanswer: Good morning: \n I am a landlady who has a few residual properties. I recently received a message from my tenants who moved out in the end of May about some questions on their deposit charges. After messages exchange with Thomas Wood, he recommend me to talk to your firm. I always included the receipts and detailed information of all charges in my deposit refund, however, they have trying to haggle away most charges: \n\n1. We have a minimum cleaning fee of $500 in our contract but the actual cleaning cost was more expensive (due to the very dirty state the bathrooms and kitchen were left in). The total charge of cleaning fee is $610 and the carpet cleaning service is $216, which is total if $826. Are we within our right to charge that actual cost which is more than the minimum cleaning fee as per our contract? \n2. We also have to remove debris that is not allowed in the trash in to be removed and transported to a dump site for $30 USD for the labor work and $16 for the dump fee together with other stuff left behind by the tenants. Is that allowed?\n3. We had instructed the tenant like all our tenants to please not use nails to hang pictures but use poster strips to prevent us having to patch and repaint. The tenants ignored that and have several nail holes in every bedroom, several poorly done patches as well as damage to base board and doors in several rooms. Each room has some paint chips, and some scratches on the baseboards and on the walls, nothing too excessive, but many small pieces. Does this still constitute normal wear and tear? The tenants lived in the house for 2 years but had received a house that had new floor installed, walls redone and painted, base boards repainted and several other repairs just before they moved in. We charge the 275 USD for the contractors labor, but the tenants try to argue this should belong to normal wear and tear. While each individual item may be waived as normal wear and tear the aggregate of all items for us constituted more than normal wear and tear. How do we define normal wear and tear? \n4. The tenants are asking us only charge the minimum cleaning fee and the carpet which they damaged, nothing more. Otherwise, they threaten us to a small court. Do they have a case? \n5. There are things we covered and never asked from them. If this case goes to court, can we go back these expenses, for example late fees for rent that we decided to waive twice as well as the cost of a drywall repair that we did not charge to the tenants?\n6. What advise would you give me to reply the tenants? \n\nThank you and looking forward to talk to someone in your firm. \n\nBest\nXiaoxin Chen \n\nposition: 0\nquestion: Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting.\n\nanswer: Max Halpern, Hagan Reynard, William Bennett, and Nathan Gangelhoff \nposition: 1\nquestion: We need to clear any potential conflicts of interest.

        "Transcript Paragraphs Transcript": "\nSpeaker 0: Recording. I have a Xiao Xin. I think it's Xiao Xin. Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Doing well. How are you doing today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Doing well. Thank you. I'm Shaoxing. You're, I think, Kate?\n\nSpeaker 0: Caleb Marshall.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello. Yes. Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's a pleasure to meet you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Glasses all the time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, no. You're totally fine. I'm also joined today with, one of my associate or one of my fellow attorneys, Emily. So she's gonna be in here while we're going over this for training purposes and stuff like\n\nSpeaker 1: that. Perfect. Perfect. Great. So have you, by chance, read through, quickly read through my, list agreement with the attendant?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I have looked through some of that. But before we get, like, really into it, there's just a couple housekeeping things to go over real quick. Okay. So the first one is that this conversation is being recorded for note taking purposes, just so you're aware.\n\nThe other is, everything we talk about is gonna be completely confidential unless, of course, you give us written permission to share anything in this conversation with somebody else. Yep. Or if you tell us something that makes us think that there's a serious risk of harm to someone, we have to report that. Do you have any questions? Any questions about any of that?\n\nNo. Awesome. So, yes, I have had the chance to review your your lease a little bit and to kinda look at some of the the things that previous tenants are are disputing about this. But I was curious. Can you just kinda give me kind of a quick list of the things that they are saying they shouldn't have to pay for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. I have the total, deposit. Sorry. They have total deposit of $2,500. And the $610 was charged for their cleaning service.\n\nAnd the, $216 is a charge for their carpet cleaning. Those two are cleaned by professional service. And that is $896.10 with a charge for a dance room carpet that was, changed before they moved in. It's a completely new, but they have two biggest thing that cannot be removed anymore. We decide to actually go ahead and pull out the carpet and redo that part.\n\nAnd then there is $415.13, which is repair, including the blind handles, touch up work in the house, and so on. I did not charge any materials. I did not charge any paint. I didn't charge any, anything, like that. That gives them about $306 and $77 back.\n\nDuring this process, after they receive it, they start arguing about the blinds, which they said first of all, the blind was not installed for us that time. They feel that could have become from previous pendant was already first they claimed that was never handled there, which I have some of them had handle picture, but not every single of them. So they argued about that. The second thing they also argued about, the handle was actually, no. The the this line was not installed for them, So it should not be their responsibility.\n\nIt could come from the previous handle that was already damaged and da da da, which I don't think so. But anyway so I did not wanna make that so complicated for everybody. So I I refund them $115.13 for all the things I charge for the handle, which left, $300 left for the repairs. So right now, they're coming back. You saw the last email exchange.\n\nSo the last email exchange is they feel the only thing they should be responsible is $896.10 for the carpet downstairs because I did provide a receipt to them that I did two years ago before they move in. So it's brand new for them. And then they wanna pay $56 because they left so much trash and the sofa stuff. We have the hallway. That's a contract fee.\n\nAnd then the $500 minimum, cleaning fee. That is all they still they can they can do. So the really, the dispute part is about $626 from them, at this point.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So given that said, we had I have always trying to work out with them from beginning to end, and I have some more message exchange with them because I couldn't actually send it over the email anymore. It was just too big to file. I have about 25 photos I took for the for the damage that I did in the house. Like, I told them very openly. Nothing major.\n\nBut it's the faceboard chip. There is a chips on the wall. There's a few nail holes on the wall. There is, some chips of the paint lost in the closet and so on. So scratch.\n\nMhmm. It's because it's a 1,900 square feet house, so that adds up by the bit. There's a five hour work that come from the contractors. So I actually listed that for them. Of course, they actually argue that there's normal wear and tear.\n\nSo, of course, from our point of view, we would like to understand what is definition of normal wear chairs from Utah also, like, Bali. And, you know, so far as I understand, the normal wear chairs is based on what the landlord technically gave a certain certain requirements, but I could be running you know, so one thing I feel is common sense and the moral center. Another sense is the law tells me, no. This is not okay to charge. So I would like to understand.\n\nAnd at what point, you know, if one day because this is not gonna be the only case. I've been doing this for eight, nine years now. I have never had people threaten me to go to court. I always find it work out with everybody. But at this point, we also see the change of attendance.\n\nThe younger generation are I feel more entitled and also very, disrespectful, in manual decision. So given that that, I want to understand what your definition is. Let's say you represent me in the court. At the worst stage, you feel, oh, the normal volunteers, I can present, and we will win the case.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's that's kind of my question. And, of course, the cleaning, like, you saw my question is, I have minimum I stayed under contract. $500 minimum cleaning. That's what I estimate. But the house was left pretty dirty station, and, we I had the cleaning service list of things with that that they done.\n\nAnd so they so $6.10 and the and everything has increased the price. Okay. These people, I had used it for six, seven years. So they always been the same people going there to touch up a house, always been the same people who do that. And I'm not this landlord going there just say, let's do a quick cleanup.\n\nNo. I'm actually really detailed. I do clean. So they all benefit when they move in. Everything was a perfect clean station.\n\nAnd then I send big people back in again, say that this is what they charge for. And they feel they're very reasonable for that price. So can I do that? And, of course, you know, on top of that, there's carpet in the house, and I have to have professional people come clean and sanitize, which is I also provide receipt as can I do that? In all that's kinda really, the fundamental question is, at what point I should say, okay.\n\nI I won't charge you for that in the future.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Good questions. The first one I'm gonna address is the cleaning fee that's in the lease. They're allowed to have reasonable cleaning fees that are automatically deducted just at the end of the the duration of the lease, just part of it. So I believe the $500 limit is something that would be considered reasonable.\n\nThey it there isn't, like, a specific number where the court is, like, right here is the actual cutoff. So as long as it's a reasonable cleaning fee, it's something that is allowed in in a lease. And so where that is a contractual obligation, that is something that they're obligated to have, like, deducted from their, excuse me, that they're obligated to have deducted from the deposit, and that's Uh-huh. Something that's reasonable right there.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, do you think the $6.10 plus $216 for the carpet clean, would that be French?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think so long as everything is documented and justified, you're not just since you said, like, that was the the what the cleaning company gave you and they said this make a blanket statement. So fact that it's very documented and meticulous, that's gonna be more reasonable. However, one thing to remember is with any of the answers that we give you about this kind of stuff, it's to an extent, it's our best guess based on the law and the ways and the things that we can find. But let's just pretend we were in court right now. Yeah.\n\nUltimately, it would depend on what the judge or if there were a jury involved, what the jury would determine is reasonable in those circumstances.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So but that just would depend. But for the most part, I think that that sounds reasonable from what I've been able to to read so far and what I know\n\nSpeaker 1: at\n\nSpeaker 0: this point. As far as normal wear and tear, the courts the Utah court had some very specific cases dealing with this sort of stuff. One of the big things is it's very fact dependent. So each case is a little bit different. Some are gonna say that this might be considered wear and tear with other things might not be.\n\nBut one of the big things that they've said that are consistently considered wear and tear, and that's the the duty of the landlord to take care of, is things like nail holes in walls and little bits of painting. Those are the sorts of things that a landlord is supposed to be able to bear. There's considered wear and tear. But all of this is also contingent on the time frame. So, like, if they were there for say, you only have them for six months and they did a lot of damage, that's gonna be different versus if, say, they were there for five or more years, but they didn't do as much, but there's there's still gonna be, you know, for five years, how much damage is there and how is it reasonable.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so So what what is actually for example, let's maybe quantify to the hours. So what do you think is reasonable for two years stay there? Are we looking about three hours patch up work, five hour? You know, that that also, of course, is not only particular to this case. It's also gonna be helping me in the future to actually say, hey.\n\nMy next tenant move out, would I charge them for three hour patchwork? Would I charge them a five hour patchwork? What what what should be kinda reasonable rent from your experience technically?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that one, I it's gonna be harder for me to be able to to kind of pin down a specific, like, number. Mhmm. Let's see here. So usually, what the what I guess, one of the things that they that they use when they're determining, the reasonableness of the wear and tear caused is kind of what what the tenant's duty is in returning the premises. So their legal obligation is to return the premises to you in the condition that you gave it to them might minus the wear and tear.\n\nSo if there are gonna be things like scuffs, you know, marks here and there, whatever, things like that, chip paint, holes in the wall, little holes, nail holes\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Those sorts of things are to be expected. Now if there's a lot of nails in one little spot, that's probably not gonna be considered reasonable. You're gonna have to wonder what that was about. So it's it really is gonna be kind of contingent on sort of the the the the basis as you go. But, also, what condition did you leave it in when you gave it to them?\n\nAnd I I looking through the communications you shared with them, you try your best to make sure it's in as good as conditions can be without, you know, replacing everything. And then you turn it over to them. So\n\nSpeaker 1: But either wall, in fairness, I have to say, I have been implemented zero hole on the wall policy from the day one. I took over any of the rental properties. Don't like people leaving holes on the walls. I check every single of them, and every single thing that if I saw that was a chip, I will touch up. That is a condition to give to my attendant, and I can expecting that back.\n\nLike I said, if I have one or two holes in the wall, I wouldn't make a fuss about it. It's it's just more every room has it. Every room at baseboard has chip. You know? That that kinda really adds up.\n\nAnyway so go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna interrupt.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. You're good. And that actually really helps in in kind of Yeah. My answer in saying it's gonna depend on what's gonna be reasonable for the home. So if you have, say, four bedrooms and there are four people living in you know, one person living in each room, then each person is gonna be kind of entitled to their own use of that room with a reasonable amount of, let's say, nails or things might scuff up the paint or cause, you know, small chips here and there.\n\nYeah. So but that's gonna be kind of, like, based throughout the whole home. So it's it's one of those things where it's gonna have to be looked at on what's reasonable. So it's little little things are even if it I mean, I guess depending how much it is and how much it costs, that might be something that you could try to make more actionable. Okay.\n\nBut it's not gonna be as likely where it's the smaller things. Like, even if it's throughout the whole house, if it's just a bunch of little things but they are scattered appropriately. Okay. It's not likely to be something that's gonna be their responsibility. But Okay.\n\nSort of as a as a kind of a a nuance to that is, in some of the pictures you showed that there is a spot where there was a hole and somebody tried to patch it and then they painted it but themselves. You know, there's no professional. There's whatever. And the holes appear to be about, I don't know, maybe a fist size or or a\n\nSpeaker 1: little bit bigger.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And so those sorts of things are gonna be considered more like damage, not just normal wear and tear, but, like, actual damage. And so in that case, they should be liable for something like that, especially if there is in the lease, like, a place for them to be responsible for repairs and to what extent. And if they have a a duty in the lease to contact you for certain repairs before they make them and then they don't, then they breach that portion of the lease, and they're gonna be more likely to be liable for that damage than otherwise.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the the and which came to the next banks? They claim it wasn't them. It was must come from the previous I sometimes it's really difficult because we do take pictures before they move in, but then maybe not to the focus point, oh, is every single corner has been checked. You know, every picture has it. Most time, we take an overall picture.\n\nSome of them we can't focus in. Some of them we can't focus in. That is actually what's the the real I I guess that's the part they know so they can't argue back. But which that kinda bring me to the question to you is, I know Utah is allowed to have an unrefundable unrefundable deposit. Mhmm.\n\nAnd but we just have to know what is it covering for. And, can I, in the future, for example, writing in my in my, contract saying, a thousand dollar unrefundable deposit covers your cleaning and, I don't know, touch up and whatever? Can I do that, or should I tell them, no? There's a thousand dollars. What I don't want end up is having people moving out.\n\nI end up with $2.03, $4,000 of repairs Okay. And I have made my contract so relaxed they can get away with that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No. Yes. You can to an extent. I don't know where the limitation is on what is considered reasonable for a nonrefundable deposit.\n\nI think that will vary from, like, rental unit to unit because of different space and and condition and all that stuff. But you can do that. There is a possibility that that starts to limit some of your recoverability depending on the extent of the damage. So, like, if they start to do certain damage and it's technically covered by that portion of the lease, so are the the deposit. Depending on the language of that you used, that may limit your ability to recover more.\n\nSo if that is something that you thought about doing, it'd be something to that would before I could give a definitive answer, I'd have to do some a little more research, but it'd be one of those things that you'd wanna make sure the physique is just so so that you didn't completely preclude all of your remedies. Yep. But at the same time, you know, make sure it's not overreaching, I guess, as well. And it's it's,\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. We are planning to have maybe, after when this thing settled, I would like to maybe one of you or I don't know whether you or somebody else going through our, contract. I wanna make sure this contract is airtight if I have to do. I don't want I I I don't I don't enjoy charge them money. I don't charge that for my own thing.\n\nMy hours doesn't I don't charge people for management fee. I don't charge that. But I also feel it was not okay. Kids today do not take their responsibilities anymore, but, which is fine. So at this point of time, I I think I I sent you questions, the list.\n\nI I just I can look at it. So I guess the first one you did actually answer my question about cleaning. The second thing, the the debris, they emptied with ours, so they would pay for it. You know, we talk about normal wear chairs a little bit more. And then oh, another thing is, of course, they would probably, if they really get a point to, to really go to a small court file to a, mediation or actually any kind of, cases.\n\nMhmm. My question is, at that point, do I have a staff? Example, they have twice late for their payment for the rent. It wasn't a long time. It was, like, one of them is few minutes.\n\nOther one's, like, hour. I never charge people a space fee. I just I I don't believe in that. I feel that most times people wanting to work with me, you know, I have enough tenant, that I feel I understand sometimes it's just hot. You know?\n\nFor a day or two, I'm okay with it. And they sometimes forgot, so I just send a reminder, hey. Now you guys haven't paid out, your rent yet. Can you actually send over? And most times, they are actually quite on time.\n\nThey occasionally do well twice. They're late. If we get to the court, can I actually put this one back? Or say, you know, since you didn't charge initially, this is done. This like, the court would not actually consider it.\n\nI mean, this is worst case if they bring me to the court, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the short answer is it depends. It'll depend on on the contract, at least what it says specifically that late fees. And if there's a provision there that says, like, even if even if the landlord doesn't act on this immediately, that doesn't, like, preclude their option to to act on it later, things like that. So if they were in fact late, then that puts them in breach. Like, not just almost late, but, like, actually\n\nSpeaker 1: late.\n\nSpeaker 0: And by all technical senses of the term that puts them in breach of the contract, and then whatever remedies are provided for in the contract are then available for that breach. If you choose not to act on that, then depending on the language of the contract and on a few other things, you'd have to double check with the law. You might be able to bring that as maybe a counterclaim if they were to come against you, but it also might not be an option. It just depends sort of on on the facts of the situation. But, also, I would say at this point, if they were to try to come after you in small claims or sue you in court, whatever the issue may be, the wear and tear is one that they might be able to they'd be more successful with than some of the others.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Everything else, if you've been meticulous in your, meticulous in your records of everything, the the, receipts, invoices, whatever it may be, the the whatever notes the professionals, like the contract or whatever made, those sorts of things are gonna be very helpful in supporting your claims and, I think, for the most part, should keep you covered. I cannot guarantee that, of course, because we don't know how this all\n\nSpeaker 1: goes. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I I think that would be that at this point. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what was the best I go back to them? I mean, I I received that message on July 4. I kinda ruined my weekend. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nBut but it's understandable. Like, I told them, I understand every single tenant wants to get back their deposit as much as they can. I was once a renter before. It's not like, I never understand that. I never been charged.\n\nMhmm. So my question for you as a whole would you suggest me to do next? Should I go back to kinda physically, de escalate that? Or I you know, I don't technically, to be honest, the the the call, you know, if I spend our call with your firm, I would be able to just give them money back. I can just get rid of.\n\nRight? That, for me, is more the principle. I really feel little bit disappointed since I feel on the way, I always been very responsive, and I'm all those landlord are like I had the people professional managing my house before. They don't respond in couple weeks for after. Unless something is like the ceiling of the floor is down, but they don't respond.\n\nAnd ever since I took over, most everything is taken care in twenty four hours. I always work out of time. And I feel a little bit disappointed the way how they approach it, but I cannot I don't want my emotion get into that. It's better to resolve it in a rational way and so everybody would be safe. That's just close job and to move forward with.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. I think depending on the situation Mhmm. This is this is gonna more compromise that I'm suggesting, than whatever. But and it also depends on what you want. So, you know, take take this for what you want.\n\nI think it wouldn't hurt to go back at this point and say, listen. Based on a few things related to the wear and tear, you know, it's like, I'm willing to come down x amount of money, you know, say that you're not gonna charge them or that you'll return x amount depending on what, you know, you like, when you compare everything you had to do for painting or or repair, whatever that may be. Yeah. What about that? I believe it's like something that you would have had to just chips, the nails, you know, those kinds of things, whatever that may be.\n\nSo, you know, subtract some of that money and say that you'll give that back to them. You could even say and this would, again, depend on the cost. And this is more of a show of good faith. This is not something you necessarily have to do. Yeah.\n\nBut with the the the larger spot that has been patched, those spots, you could say, listen. If you know, again, this is depending on the cost. If they're willing to just be done, you know, be like, listen. I can give you back some get over this one because I firmly disagree and say that this is normal wear and tear. It's clearly not.\n\nAnd I believe it's your doing. Right? Because unless they can prove otherwise, technically, it is that's where we're at. You know? So but you could say I'm willing to at least refund, you know, x x amount to cover whatever would have been charged for this and for the wear and tear.\n\nBut that's, like, as far as I'm willing to go at this point. Everything else, I believe, is, you know, reasonable. And if, you know, if they want to dispute it, they can it's gonna be their responsibility to prove that they didn't commit, you know, this kind of damage or whatever it\n\nSpeaker 1: may be. So they have to prove they didn't do it. It's not Yeah. They don't need to prove. Okay.\n\nNo.\n\nSpeaker 0: If they if they were to come against you in a claim to say that you owe them money, they're the plaintiff, and they're gonna have to prove their case. So\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That makes sense. Because right now, the only picture they have is the ones I sent to them when we changed the carpet last year. And that was not a focus on yet, and then you said that against me for the for the handles right now. So I'm just saying, you know, that sometimes at a certain point, you just have to cut your loss and forget about it.\n\nOkay. So that that make a lot more sense. And, also, is there anything else I need to be careful with? Because right now, I feel everything I say to these people, Like, let's say, I don't believe if the kids drafted the message. I think that there is a behind the drafting a message for them.\n\nMhmm. And I, I just need I wanna keep them short and simple. I don't wanna give them more useful. You know, for example, I comment on, so, you know, the blinds can be easily break. And then they said, oh, he says, you know it's easily break, so it should be normal.\n\nWear it here. I feel everything I said has been against me instead of helping me to explaining, you know, things that happened.\n\nSpeaker 0: So But yeah. I guess sort of as a as a general statement there, don't admit anything outright. Don't say, yes. That's totally my fault. This is totally what we should do.\n\nDon't do it that way. Don't try to be sneaky either, but just say, like, the way things are, I believe that, you know, this is something you guys are liable for, but I'm willing to refund x amount of money. Therefore, you're not showing fault. You're not admitting to anything. You're just saying because of this, I believe that, you know, I'm willing to work with you on this level, except for the stuff with the wear and tear because that's the stuff that you should be, you know, dealing with regularly anyway.\n\nOkay. But you don't even have to admit to that. And as I just say that, you know, you just you know, you've talked to somebody about it. You could say you talked to a lawyer. Don't say whom specifically unless we're, like, representing you.\n\nBut, like, just say that, you know, you've looked into it some more, and you're like, okay. With some of the wear and tear, I see where you're coming from. Here's where we are. But But some other things to do they're like, you know, I believe that this is where we are, but I'm willing to do this. That way you're not admitting fault, but you're still trying to show that you're being reasonable with them to hopefully get them to stop pushing the issue.\n\nYeah. But so that's one thing is don't admit to anything. Another is if they do try to bring any kind of action, even if they just say they have an attorney to send you a demand letter. The demand letter isn't taking you to court. It's just them sending a letter saying, hey.\n\nDo something or we're gonna take you to court. It's more of a threat of a lawsuit. Yeah. Even if that happens, talk to a lawyer immediately. Reach out to us and say, like, hey.\n\nI got this letter from this attorney. I need to know what I'm supposed to do. Don't wait on any of that because that can really, like, slow down the timeline or or or, you know, mess up the opportunity to respond at all. Yes. Another is this is more in the future, but, don't make any restrictions in the lease the lease other than what you have already until you've talked to an attorney about that as well.\n\nJust like with the nails and stuff, I don't know if that's something that could be restricted in the future or not. And so that would be something that would be worth looking into ahead of time as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So yeah. I think So\n\nSpeaker 1: do you do your form draft those kinda looking over the for example that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You could schedule another consultation like this. Or if you want an extensive deep dive redrafting of everything, that could be a separate retainer where it might be something we charge. I don't know. It could be $3,000 retainer upfront to review everything, draft it out.\n\nJust depends on the you know, how much it is. And then\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Obviously. Yeah. Okay.\n\nAlright. Maybe we will, we will book another consultation, and we can start with review first. And, once Mhmm. The lawyer probably review my, contract and say, hey. You know, maybe we need more time.\n\nYou can let us know. I'm willing to pay the hours, and I think, like, just like I said, I'm always doing everything by book, and I'm always trying to be fair on that front. I'm not trying to cheat any of them, and I don't get rich just to make $600. I mean, it's nice to have it, but it's not something I have to live on that. Okay.\n\nAlright. Anything else you would like to recommend me to at this point?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't have any recommendations off the top of my head. I wouldn't ask. Do I do you have any recommendations that\n\nSpeaker 2: just a couple of questions. There's Uh-huh. There's a section, that said, that there could be an addendum of moving condition property condition addendum. Did you have anything that was attached to that where they listed any other damages that had happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: It I didn't. I mean Okay. Most of the cases is their damage. I always do. It happened for this particular house two years ago because they moved in.\n\nThe the previous tenant got in their, pet without our permission. So that is what happened, and we actually have to end up pulling out all carpet, repaying all the walls. So, technically, the house is renovated. I have all the documents. I have the printout receipt from 2023 when we did everything.\n\nBut, we the reason we didn't have this, generally, we do the walk through with renters. And when the renters signed the list, they when we actually hand over the keys, they were not there. None of them were there. They were all out of state care. So they went home.\n\nAnd when they came back, I told them very openly, if there is any issue, if you see any hole, if you see any damage I didn't see, let me know. Okay. That was never let me know. That was I have all the message between all, obviously. Yeah.\n\nI don't you know, I it's no point to delay any so I have all this, but I definitely never, like, ignored.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did know on the contract on paragraph 15, it did talk about, alterations and just is the condition of the property in good working or does not list here. You mentioned I think I heard you say that they actually had painted over that patch or tried to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. It's in the one of the bedrooms actually, a couple of bedrooms they did, and but they claimed it wasn't them. It must come from people, which is very unlikely because when my country go in there, they don't just do a small patch hole. What they do is they do a bigger paint area. So you can you you see that uniform.\n\nYou you don't on the side, you look at all the polka dots. Right. You know, maybe they're all white, but they're all white polka dot. That's the you know, I the the things, like I said, I've been using the same contractor for years. Yes.\n\nThere's from their argument, there's always a conflict of interest, but on the other hand, he has his own business. He's not gonna lose his business lesson for that couple $100. It is not he won't do any force claim for me. You know, if I have to get that statement, I can get all those thing. I already got my clean lady statement.\n\nOn what she what she her breakdown exactly her breakdown, what she asked for $610.04. What I've done that once I received this message, this I did not respond to that anymore because I wanna make sure I talk to a lawyer first before I respond to them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, and I love what Caleb said about, you know, the fact that we can we can help go through the contract and work on some of these issues. I know you said, you know, what what qualifies as normal wear and tear? So the fact that Utah allows you to use a $500 deposit, something that you might consider in the future is sit down and actually doing the numbers on what does that $500 cover. Typically, how much does it cost to clean an average home? How much does it cost to do the carpet repair?\n\nAnd then if you are having to do those holes and fix fix the nails and you do that, you may ask yourself, are those repairs that I'm doing, or am I paying somebody else? And if you look at your typical average space and you're going, on average, I'm spending about about $60 in labor per house or per unit in order to fix that normal wear and tear, that may be something that you attempt to include in that cost amount. Now having said that, it's something that we would definitely want to look at for sure and make Yeah. Make sure that we can do that. But it is something that you would be able to monetize that amount for you so that you are able to say to them, I'm giving you the benefit of not having to pay for this wear and tear because chip.\n\nContracts, you can pretty much contract for a lot of things. If they agree to it and you agree to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's that's what we we used to always have everything as refundable, then we always argue why do we spend this money to clean. Right. And the good news is, I don't go there myself clean. Okay? That's just not gonna happen.\n\nSure. Because I know once people come back to me, I have to clean a few hours. Why do you charge this much money? Right. I hire professional to do that.\n\nFirst of all, they do better work. Second of all, of course, you know, that is reasonable that they were is coming from. Right? Anyway, I guess I could\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't wanna be too specific on you know, you said, do I have to label that? Do I have to you could even consider coming up with the definition between the two of you that says for the purposes of this contract, we agree that the term normal wear and tear will include no more than three holes per per bedroom, no more than three scuffs or whatever. That is something that would be looked at by a firm to be able to sit down and say, what has case law said in the past? What have the courts looked at in those little circumstances? And do I really want to narrow that definition and bind myself to that contract.\n\nIf that's true and you're okay with that, then that's fine. It at least gives you finality in knowing that you have a number. And if that's what you're looking for, that may be something that's very useful in the future. And if not, you can keep it more more neutral. But I do think you have some good points in the contract that you've got, to kind of help to kind of help you towards that end.\n\nBut I do think in the and to keep in mind, do you really want to argue with this particular client over the cost of this? That that's the big picture. Right? It's not so much this person. It's really all of the others going forward.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. For sure. I mean, just like I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I mean, would you rather go go to a small particular client and spend 3 to $500 or use that money and pay the firm to kind of wrap you up a little tighter of a contract. And then and you just kinda go, where do I where am I gonna invest my money on this one?\n\nSpeaker 1: And that makes sense. There's no question about it. That's why I'm here in the\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Competition because I want to understand where do I improve in the future. And I'm actually continue making quite decent amount for rental property. Just like I said, I've been doing that for eight years, and I'm planning continue doing that, and we continue buying houses to rent. I wanna make sure this is being professionally done. Yeah.\n\nInto the point as much as we can. You can never guarantee, you know, today's time, it it I I think, like I said, doing that so many years, I have seen a generation and a generation of kids growing up and, you know, some of them being with me for twelve years. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 2: It's it's definitely different. The only other thing that we would maybe suggest is I know a lot of landlords will do a video because it is hard to have the pictures. Sometimes the video walk through, catches a little bit more, in the space. But then again, you're you're dealing with all of that data that you're storing. So that becomes a that that's another suggestion I would have in addition to pictures.\n\nSo\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Alright. That's that's actually good point with the videos. And also the thing is because people I know people can go back to you to the small court in two years. So I generally always keep the data in two years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this time, it just becomes I had the previous pictures, but the problem is we're actually entering the two years. So it actually automatically delayed the previous years' pictures. That really made me a little bit mad. I may have to extend that to three or four years. Okay.\n\nThat circumstance. But, anyway but thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I definitely do I just directly reach out to your firm to make appointment for my contract?\n\nSpeaker 0: I was actually gonna ask, do you want us to have our our receptionist reach out to you to schedule an appointment or schedule another consult?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Either way is fine. Yeah. Either way is fine. I'm I'm I'm okay with it.\n\nEither way, you can send have them send me emails so I can schedule time with them. Mhmm. Or, I'm I'd be happy to you're in. Maybe not happy to drive either. Okay.\n\nBut alright. So but everything else, yeah, please do reach out. Thank you so much. Yeah. Alright.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one. Yeah. Thank you. Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bye.\n",

Consultation Overview\nThe consultation centered on HOA disputes involving selective enforcement and harassment. Attorney Kinley demonstrated strong active listening skills and maintained professional composure throughout. The flow was natural, though slightly meandering at times. Critical moment occurred at pricing discussion (36:00 mark).\n\n2. Attorney Performance Analysis\n\nExpertise Demonstration (89/100):\nStrong display of HOA law knowledge, particularly regarding Community Association Act. Notable quote demonstrating expertise:\n\"In Utah, it's a bilateral thing. It's just automatically interpreted where any attorneys fees provision goes both ways.\"\n\nSales Technique (83/100):\nGood rapport building but delayed value proposition. Key quote showing empathy:\n\"I personally feel like you're kind of getting screwed here, so I'm happy to just spend at least a little bit of time looking over it for you\"\n\nProfessional Presence (90/100):\nMaintained consistent professionalism while building personal connection. Effectively managed time and set clear expectations.\n\nClient Engagement (86/100):\nStrong initial rapport but could have better controlled narrative flow. Excellent transparency about fees and process.\n\n3. Critical Moments\n- Successful intervention: Transparent discussion of retainer refund policy\n- Missed opportunity: Could have emphasized urgency of action earlier\n- Key turning point: Personal disclosure about previous career (software engineering) which built additional rapport\n\n4. Retention Analysis\nPending decision hinges on:\n- Client's financial situation (maternity leave mentioned)\n- Wife's input (primary breadwinner)\n- Risk/reward assessment of retainer investment\n\n5. Improvement Recommendations\n- Earlier presentation of value proposition\n- More structured narrative control\n- Clearer articulation of immediate action benefits\n- Development of alternative fee arrangements for price-sensitive clients\n\n6. Comparative Analysis\nPerformance aligns with industry standards for initial consultations, with notably strong transparency and technical expertise demonstration. Above average empathy display and rapport building.\n\nRed Flags Noted:\n- Client's price sensitivity\n- Multiple mentions of temporary housing situation\n- Hesitation about retainer amount\n\nBest Practices Demonstrated:\n- Clear explanation of legal concepts\n- Strong active listening\n- Excellent transparency about fees\n- Effective use of personal anecdotes for rapport\n\nOverall Assessment:\nAttorney Kinley demonstrated strong technical expertise and professional presence while maintaining authentic engagement. The B+ grade reflects strong fundamentals with room for improvement in sales technique and urgency creation. The pending retention status suggests effective consultation but price sensitivity barriers."

Her husband discovered water in the kitchen, leading to significant damage, including a broken basement ceiling. The insurance company, State Farm, recommended ServPro for mitigation, but the work was inadequate, leading to further issues. ServPro's bid was $22,000, while Campbell Maintenance's was $28,000. Milena is awaiting insurance approval for repairs, which could be $28,000. She also mentioned additional damages, such as broken appliances and a countertop, and is considering legal action against ServPro if insurance does not cover these costs.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/I7ucHQfWHtuuagNvzwwQjnrQB3A?view=transcript>\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Have Campbell Maintenance write a letter outlining how Servpro's actions exacerbated the damage.\n- [ ] Get bids to replace the damaged countertops and appliances.

Ashley, who owns Demas LLC with her four underage kids, leased the truck to HBM but did not have liability insurance. The truck, worth around $150,000, is now in a tow yard in Wyoming. Hepworth suggests Ashley hire legal representation to negotiate with HBM, which may be liable for the truck's value. He outlines a potential legal strategy, including sending a demand letter and possibly filing a lawsuit. Ashley agrees to retain Hepworth's services, understanding the potential costs and the need for a retainer payment.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/CiRJ7NRMVa9jenqt5GfNIH_Wnxk?view=transcript>\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Michael Hepworth will send a demand letter to HBMC Transportation LLC requesting their insurance information and notifying them his firm represents Ashley.\n- [ ] Michael Hepworth will contact the tow yard where Ashley's totaled truck is being stored to inquire about storage and transportation options.\n- [ ] Ashley will forward any further communications from HBMC Transportation LLC to Michael Hepworth and his legal team.\n## Decisions made\n- Ashley decided to retain Michael Hepworth's legal services to handle her case against HBMC Transportation LLC.\n- They agreed on a $10,000 retainer fee to be placed in the attorney-client trust account.\n- It was decided that Michael would contact Cody (from HBMC) to inform him of legal representation and request insurance information.\n## Issues & Risks\n- The main issue is the totaled semi-truck that Ashley leased to HBMC Transportation LLC.\n- There's a concern about insurance coverage, as Ashley was under the impression that the driver would have full coverage, but only liability insurance was in place.\n- The contract between Ashley and HBMC is unclear and potentially unfavorable to Ashley.\n- There's a risk that Ashley might be held liable for the damaged truck, despite not having control over its operation.\n- Concern about potential storage fees for the damaged truck.\n## Next steps\n- Michael Hepworth will contact Cody from HBMC to inform him of legal representation and request insurance information.\n- Sarah (Michael's colleague) will email Ashley with the plan of action.\n- Ashley needs to send all documents and emails related to the case to Michael's team.\n- Ashley should cease direct communication with HBMC and refer them to Michael if contacted.\n- Michael's team will review the contract and insurance information once received.\n## Questions discussed\n- \"Who owns Demas LLC?\"\n- \"Did you put the title in Demas name, or has it always been just under your name?\"\n- \"Was your ex husband driver or ex boyfriend? Was he driving for he was driving it, yeah?\"\n- \"What's the market value on the truck right now?\"\n- \"Do you have a business liability policy for Demas?\"\n## Timeline\n- Michael hopes to get insurance information from HBMC by the end of the week.\n- They expect to know if HBMC's insurance will pay Ashley or not by the beginning of the following week.\n- The accident occurred on August 29th (year not specified).\n- The leasing agreement was signed on January 22nd of the current year.\n## Outline\n### Leasing a Semi-Truck and Initial Details\n- Michael Hepworth explains the attorney-client privilege and asks for a picture for better recall.\n- Ashley leased a semi-truck to a company, HBM, with the impression of full coverage, but only had liability.\n- The truck is owned by Demas LLC, which Ashley owns with her four underage kids.\n- Ashley's ex-husband, not her, bought the truck, and it was leased out due to financial difficulties.\n### Contract Details and Liability Issues\n- The truck was leased to HBM, but the contract was not reviewed by an attorney.\n- The truck was totaled in an accident where the driver fell asleep, and there was no other vehicle involved.\n- Ashley did not have insurance on the truck, relying on HBM's liability.\n- The truck is still in a tow yard in Wyoming, and Ashley has pictures of the damage.\n### Driver's Actions and Concerns\n- The driver, Dustin McCrab, was cited for the accident and admitted to another recent accident.\n- Ashley is concerned about potential lawsuits from the driver's injuries.\n- HBM hired the driver, and Ashley was not informed about the driver's past accidents.\n- The truck was bought in 2001, and its market value has significantly decreased.\n### Insurance and Contractual Obligations\n- Ashley did not have business liability insurance for Demas LLC.\n- Michael advises that future trucks should not be in her personal name to avoid liability.\n- The contract with HBM was signed in January 2022, and Ashley has not had the truck since then.\n- HBM required a $15,000 maintenance escrow, which was deducted from Ashley's payroll.\n### Contract Review and Liability Concerns\n- The contract with HBM is heavily skewed in their favor, with ambiguous terms.\n- HBM is responsible for fuel and insurance, but Ashley is liable for damages.\n- The contract does not clearly state who is responsible for trailer leases and damages.\n- Michael expresses concern that the contract may absolve HBM of liability.\n### Insurance and Legal Strategy\n- Michael advises that the contract is ambiguous and may benefit Ashley in a court.\n- HBM's insurance should cover the truck's value, but Ashley should have had her own insurance.\n- Michael suggests sending a demand letter to HBM to clarify their liability and insurance details.\n- Ashley should not take possession of the truck until the situation is clearer.\n### Next Steps and Legal Representation\n- Michael will send a demand letter to HBM and request insurance information and details about the accident.\n- Ashley should not continue negotiating with HBM without legal representation.\n- Michael will handle all communications with HBM and ensure Ashley is updated throughout the process.\n- Ashley should transfer the retainer payment to Michael's attorney client trust account.\n### Retainer Agreement and Legal Process\n- Michael explains the retainer agreement, including the hourly billing rate and the storage of funds in the attorney client trust account.\n- Ashley should provide all documents and communications with HBM to Michael.\n- Michael will call HBM to inform them of the legal representation and request the necessary information.\n- Ashley should not contact HBM directly and should refer all communications to Michael.\n### Final Steps and Client Support\n- Michael will update Ashley on the progress and ensure she is informed at every step.\n- Ashley should not take possession of the truck until the situation is resolved.\n- Michael will work with his team to handle the case efficiently and effectively.\n- Ashley should feel confident that the legal team will handle the situation professionally and aggressively.\n\n",

        "Detailed Task List": "Jeremy Vogel is HVAC contractor. Owns 3 Lamborghini.  Member of St. George Car Club. Rip Rally.\n\nCL claims he is being discriminated against as a single father because he has fast cars and his Ex's ex-dated prosecutors or had some other personal connection with investigating PO. CL provided no written or visual evidence supporting this claim.\n\nCL  was not arrested or detained by PO. CL was charged and convicted of custodial interference. However, he believes that he has been harassed and discriminated against by Washington County, Santa Clara City, and St. George peace officers because his first ex-wife dated a former County prosecutor in 2006, his Second ex-wife has some personal relationship with a PO and is represented by former city prosecutor (in the divorce).  \n\nFirst incident.\n2008 Divorce from First Wife, Nicole? Vogel, who lived in Washington City, was charged with domestic violence in 2007. City Prosecutor Matthew C. Miller dismissed the charges for Washington County; the Prosecutor allegedly dated his wife. CL claimed there was a mutual protective order but could not explain how it came about. CL claims internal affairs knocked on his door asking for information about Miller because his ex-wife, Nichole, dated Matthew Miller, and he had to quit as Washington City prosecutor and is now City Prosecutor for St. George.CL did not provide any written document or recording verifying his claims.\n\n2020 CL was pulled over by the St. George police office, level one consensual action, but it was called in as \"1060.\"   Officer Michael Koster was assigned to investigate. The officer let him go. CL did not provide any written documentation or recording of the incident.\n\nA week later, Tiffany Vogel, the CL's 2nd ex,  became suicidal, and the CL believed she was drunk, so he tried to stop her from leaving with his children. Tiffany claimed that he interfered with her parent's time.   When the PO took the statement, the PO said he heard the CL had a Lamborghini and would arrest him if he sped. Officer Blackman responded to the incident and also detained Tiffany a week earlier for driving while intoxicated in St. George. \nMark (Matt) Miller, the Prosecutor,  handled the prosecution of Tiffany's case and dropped all charges. CL did not produce any records corroborating the incident.\n\nTiffany was also charged and arrested for battery in California. CL assumes she pled down or dismissed charges. CL did not provide any written document or recording verifying his claims.\n\nCL was first charged with speeding with a Lamborghini in July 2020. Pulled over and let go. He had a police scanner at home, which he turned on and checked. He was mentioned by name as a person at the bar, and an unknown officer encouraged him to keep an eye out for him—there are no records of this incident. CL did not produce any records corroborating the incident.\n\n07/12/2022. Charged with custodial interference, Robert Cosson retained Trevor Terry to defend him. He recorded an officer who disclosed protected information and advised him to kill people who allegedly took his stuff. PO demanded that the information be removed. The officer also demanded $100 to make it go away. It sounded like a joke on the surface but felt like a threat to CL. Unfortunately, CL did not provide any written document or recording verifying his claims.\n\nCL was found guilty of custodial interference or entered a plea and abeyance. I explained this was still a guilty plea. CL states that he is Appealing the conviction;  is waiting for a court date.\n\nTiffany's divorce attorney is Jake Graff, judge(?) and also a judge in Santa Clara charged her with DUI, refusing to take a chemical test; Washington county prosecutor, who prosecutes and drops DUI with a kid in the car, dismissed with prejudice re DUI, lane violation. The police Officer knew and said he couldn't tell if she was intoxicated, failed field sobriety, or had Washington County violations. Mark Barlow was a prosecuting attorney and missed charges.\n\nIn October 2022, CL was charged with stalking by ex, unclear why. Claim his ex was drunk or smelled like alcohol at school, and PO called. PO asks for a voluntary sample. She declines and surrenders the children to CL. Lane Wood was the Prosecutor who signed an indictment. Lauren DeMarco is an attorney for Tiffany in the case against Tiffany for driving drunk/endangering their child t in June 2023. Ex claimed she was never driving and a \"friend\" drove her. I explained that he had no test or evidence from a neutral third party showing that she was drinking and driving. \n\n2015 Lane Wood (Prosecutor)  worked in the same law firm as Lynn Graff, Tiffany's attorney. CL claims this connection also shows a reason for bias.\n\nCL has only been charged and convicted of custodial interference when he allegedly withheld children from Tiffany (ex) because she appeared drunk to him.\n\nCL admits that he has never been arrested or detained on other charges.\n\nI advised him that his own hearsay testimony is not supported by recordings and, therefore, will be disregarded and deemed inadmissible; I explained the \"legal definition\" of hearsay evidence and confirmed that all but one of his allegations rely upon his own verbal hearsay allegations wasn't recorded. Therefore, it's unlikely that the evidence is strong enough to persuade a \"trier of fact\" that the PO acted outside the scope of police authority necessary to carry a 1983 claim. CL stated that there were records and transcripts documenting police officers' prejudice that he had not provided to me.\n\nI invited him to obtain a second opinion, but without a video or clear audio recording, his choices are to (1) Continue to collect evidence without legal assistance; (2) Retain the Firm ($5,000) to conduct our investigation and a written opinion on whether evidence is sufficient or. More is necessary for prosecution; (3) Retain the Firm to conduct our investigation and offer legal advice on the best use of his time and resources to gather evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case under Section 1983.\n\nHe said he was undecided and would review his written \"proof\" of discrimination.\" \n\n\n",

They have had issues with one of their suppliers, Don Cox's employee John Maskrid, who has been interfering with their business by telling contractors not to work with them.\n\n\\- John Maskrid has made defamatory statements about Bob and Terry to other contractors and real estate agents in the small town, causing them to lose business relationships. This has resulted in delays and additional costs for their projects.\n\n\\- Bob and Terry are looking for legal advice on how to handle the situation, including potentially sending a demand letter or taking legal action for defamation and interference with their business.\n\n\\- Ryan Nelson advises that their best first step is to have a direct conversation with Don Cox, John's boss, to request that John stop the defamatory behavior. He suggests they follow up the conversation with a written email documenting what was discussed.\n\n\\- If the issues continue after that, Ryan Nelson says they can then proceed with a demand letter threatening legal action, which could potentially lead to a lawsuit for defamation or interference with business relationships.\n\n\\- The group also discusses some issues Bob and Terry have had with a solar panel installation company, Intermountain Wind and Solar, and Ryan Nelson offers to assist with drafting a demand letter for those issues as well.\n",

        "Transcript Paragraphs Transcript": "\nSpeaker 0: Hi there.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Doing well. How are\n\nSpeaker 1: you doing today? Good. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Good. Hey, Rodrigo?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 0: Caleb Marshall.\n\nSpeaker 1: Caleb Marshall. Pleasure to\n\nSpeaker 0: meet you as well. Just wanna make sure I had you know, I was in the right place. That'd have been bad if I was talking to the wrong person. Anyway, so I'm one of the licensed attorneys here helping conducting your consultation. Before we get started there, just a couple quick housekeeping things.\n\nOne, we're recording conversation for note taking purposes, and everything we talk about is confidential. So nothing is gonna leave this office unless you give us written permission to to share something we talk about. Or if something you tell us makes us think that there's, like, a serious risk of harm to somebody, then we have to, you know, report that kind of stuff. But I'm not really worried about that here. But that kind of case.\n\nYes. But I gotta make sure I tell you. So, so those things, any questions about any of that? No. Alright.\n\nSo our notes are kinda sparse. It says that there's a business. I'm guessing it's yours. It need hasn't been operating for a year. It needs to repay a business loan, and that's kinda where we're at.\n\nSo what what's the story here?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I've been really brief on this. So, I started up a company, LLC, former travel, 2017. Everything went well, but we kind of implored it. Yeah.\n\nSo we took our business long to continue, with expenses and such. But it kinda got us trapped in in into that horrible habit of to repay that loan. It came really. It was difficult. Mhmm.\n\nThen, anyways, the company went under. But my only concern is I still got a repay. It looks like they're suing me for a hundred and $3,000, which is it's my obligation to pay. I signed the contract. I'm okay with that.\n\nI I understand. Mhmm. But I just wanna protect my home. Basically, as far as assets go, the the company, I never took it out of a commission. So I never filed the the forms through the state to solve the LLC.\n\nSpeaker 0: To dissolve it? It's still\n\nSpeaker 1: it's still very much open,\n\nSpeaker 0: I guess, you could say. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if my best approach would be to close it right now and then show up to court. What would be\n\nSpeaker 0: So do you you do you have any of the documents with you? Or Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if I can email to\n\nSpeaker 0: you. Yeah. Yeah. Please. Yeah.\n\nSo if you wanna send it to,\n\nSpeaker 2: c marshall. That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So just c and then m a r s h\n\nSpeaker 1: S h a. L l.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. @hepworthlegal.com. That'll just send it right to my email. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nNo. No. No worries. You're good. I It's alright.\n\nNo. No. You're fine. I would, rather just get it the first time. Whenever I, get that someone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. There\n\nSpeaker 0: you go. Whenever I'm on, like, doing Zoom consults or something, it's nice because I'll send them the thing in the chat so they can just copy and paste it if they need to. Ah. So in this case, I yeah. Happy to do that too.\n\nSo, you know, when that comes through. So so this is the complaint that you're sending me? Or Yes. Okay. Awesome.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is. And they actually attached the contract in the line\n\nSpeaker 0: of pages. I got all that good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and because of the guaranteed is that what we need?\n\nSpeaker 0: You're the you're the what's the word I'm looking for? Darren Torr, essentially. You're Yeah. Yeah. You're the one that signed on to make sure that\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: If the business couldn't pay, somebody could pay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. And I just wanna basically I don't wanna be homeless.\n\nSpeaker 0: I have to check my home.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. To start over.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You know, I I get you. Definitely don't wanna have to deal with all that. When this comes through, I'll be able to look through that quickly and kinda see what they've what they've got going. So what I'm guessing is since so so does the company have any assets at all?\n\nAny money, any equipment, anything at all?\n\nSpeaker 1: We do have some equipment tools that you know, it it would have asked to be\n\nSpeaker 0: under $20. It's not. Okay. Not. So that's still not saying you have to, but that may be something that needs to happen first is trying to sell because whatever the business owes because okay.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is with this loan, the business owes the money, and then you've signed on to make sure that the business, you know, to to secure that loan for them. So, basically, what you would have is whatever you can sell or use from the business to help satisfy that will be like, that's where they would go first Yeah. To an extent. But then there's also the fact that you would still be liable for whatever is left. So it's like, let's let's just pretend for the sake of argument that they that we went to court and there was no defense, and then the court was like, alright.\n\nHere's the judgment. You owe them this money. Right? Mhmm. So, technically, they can recover from either of you.\n\nThey can recover from the company or from you. And since that's the case, if they wanted, they could just say, hey. You have to pay us everything, and then you can go to the company and try to recover what you want from the company. Or they could try going from the company, but they're not going to if there's not as much that they can find money wise. Yeah.\n\nSo if we were to try and pay this off without going through court, like, without doing all that stuff, what I would recommend first is trying to get as much money out of the business as you can, legitimately. So whatever money that you're allowed to take from it, whatever equipment, whatever anything that you could to sell to try to help pay some of the the money toward that they're saying that you still own the loan, that would be one of the first steps because you wanna be able to try and wring it dry essentially. Yeah. That way there's because that's what it's for. Like, the the whole point of taking the loan out for the business is whatever you have the business for, the hope is to pay it back either through the business itself or whatever assets you have later to try and get through that.\n\nOtherwise so let's say that there was $20 that you could get out of it. We'll just keep it simple with that. So then there's you said that there's this it's roughly, it takes too long.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like a hundred and 3.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So we'll just say a hundred for the sake of I like round numbers. It works better for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I see.\n\nSpeaker 0: So with that, say you've managed to get 20, you pay it off, so then we're still at $80 just chilling there. That money is gonna be stuff that you're gonna have to try to pay back. And they, if it's through a judgment, are going to come to you directly at that point. And that with the judgment, they're able to do things like garnish wages, maybe put a lien on a home, something to that effect because they're gonna come at you personally.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm. I'm trying to think and make\n\nSpeaker 0: sure I'm not so yeah. So that's kind of where they're gonna be at with that is they're gonna try to or that that would be what they do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will they force you to sell the home type of thing? How can it be payment arrangements on the deal?\n\nSpeaker 0: So I was gonna say, if they go through the the judgment, they're just gonna try and come at you for whatever they can get. But if you're if they're willing to negotiate, that's when you can start working at a payment plan of some sort, maybe even have a lesser amount involved, especially if and I don't know to what level you'd be able to do this. I'm not saying you need to, but this is just sometimes an option. Sometimes when there's an amount owed, the company that's owed the money is willing to settle for a lump sum that's less than that amount. So it's like and I'm I'm not saying you have this money, but, like, let's just say that you had a way that you could get some of this money where you'd be able to get, like, 80,000 or something.\n\nBe like, look. I don't have the full amount, but I've got 80. Will you settle it for this lesser amount? Some people, depending on on what they are, but some people that have or creditors will, settle for that lesser amount because they'd rather get some money than no money. Because if somebody just ends up filing bankruptcy because they can't pay the debt, then they're out whatever.\n\nThey don't get anything. But if depending on the amount owed and depending on what your own personal ability is, they may be willing to settle for a lesser amount. What that amount is, I don't know, but that's if they're willing. But, also, there is the potential of setting up negotiations where you can say, hey. Like, I wanna pay.\n\nI've not I've never intended to not pay. I just can't do it all right now, and I don't wanna go through all this court stuff. Can we set up some payment plans? And then it just depends on what they want to do. Some creditors are very kind and are willing to just keep it pretty simple and be like, sure.\n\nYou can pay it back over two years or something, and they're gonna be high they're gonna be high payments because of that. So, you know, you it might be $5 a month or something, which is, you know, kind of a lot. But that's sometimes, depending on the situation, better than getting a judgment against you or having to file bankruptcy, whatever the issue may be, or sell a home, whatever the, you know, that kinda may be. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those those were the two things that I kinda wanted to avoid. One, be forced to sell, and two, I don't wanna file chapter 11. I don't that will set me back. Yes. Do Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Is this gonna come through or no? I'm gonna let me refresh my my page. The Internet sometimes just doesn't wanna cooperate with me despite my wall. Let me see if I can find it on exchange real quick.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you're putting it in with me. Yeah. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm I'm sure what you did was fine. Sometimes things just don't wanna come through as fast as I want them to, and that, you know, might just speak more to my impatience than anything. But So your name on the complaint is Rodrigo. Yes? Mhmm.\n\nOkay. Just wanna make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 0: they have my company\n\nSpeaker 1: in. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I'm just looking it up to see if I can just find the case. And is this in, American Fork?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that's where the\n\nSpeaker 0: court date. Okay. I think I found it. Citibank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see. I know\n\nSpeaker 0: that was filed. That was an old an old thing. Let me see here. So is Citibank the one that that is trying to get the money?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. It says Capital Servicing, Inc.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So this isn't the right case then. What's the company name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Kapidis, k a p\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I hear you good for me. K a p k a p I t u s.\n\nLet's see what that pulls up. Really? What's your company name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Residential and Commercial\n\nSpeaker 0: In commercial travel?\n\nSpeaker 1: Travel.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. Spell that for me just so I get it right. D r y w a Drive. Gotcha. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is then.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: This This\n\nSpeaker 0: is in Virginia? I think so. Yeah. I thought\n\nSpeaker 1: everybody's out in Virginia. Hold up. Well, it wasn't someone in Virginia, was it? I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's definitely in the circuit court of the county of Hanover, so I don't think you're getting a phone call. So that might be a big thing here. You may need to be finding an attorney out there. Oh, this isn't one of us at fault. Yes.\n\nSo it looks like you're gonna need to find an attorney out that way, actually. This is I'm confused. Why does this not wanna cooperate with me? You're getting that same call again? I think that you need to be let me see if I got that email finally.\n\nYou might not have sent. I think that you may need to be finding an attorney there because I'm gonna guess actually, let me see. Is you said the the contract was attached to this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. On the very bottom.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Contractor by default. Yes. Technology doesn't like me. Mhmm.\n\nI I try to be good with it, but it doesn't like me. Yeah. This is definitely in Virginia. So what you're gonna need to do is find an attorney out that way that'd be able to help you. You should be able since you're from here, you should be able to do a lot of stuff virtually.\n\nYou shouldn't have to, like, fly out there to handle this stuff. But I do believe that there's going to be a need for a need for hiring an attorney out there because we can't represent we're not licensed in Virginia, and so we wouldn't be able to help with this. So what you'd need to do is call out that way. This is Hanover. Give me one second.\n\nI'm gonna do a little looking around real quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's a problem. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry. I wish I had more to offer on that. I'm just there are a few things I wanna check out here. Is this Virginia or New what? I don't even understand.\n\nOkay. Here's this. This will help. This is what I was looking for. Contract will likely have a reference to what's called a,\n\nSpeaker 2: a\n\nSpeaker 0: sorry. I'm reading and trying to talk at the same time. We'll likely have a what's called a forum selection clause, which basically says that if if there are any disputes that come out of this contract, that they're gonna be settled in wherever the contract says. And so my guess is that that will be in Virginia. And that means that they will also have chosen the law, which will be Virginia's law and stuff like that.\n\nI am willing to bet. I cannot guarantee it, but I'm willing to bet. So I'm gonna look through this real quick. This is a very weirdly drafted contract too. That's just me making a note.\n\nMhmm. Commonwealth of Virginia. Eastern District of Virginia. So, basically, part of the contract requires that you ignore or that you accept venue and jurisdiction in in Virginia, meaning that you accept that the place that this will be heard will be in Virginia and the law and everything will apply to Virginia law. And that's what that is.\n\nSo you'll need to do is you'll need to find an attorney in Virginia. Part of what I was actually doing just a second ago was let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you think the best approach for me to reach out to them\n\nSpeaker 0: and try to get a Well, let's this trial. At this point, it looks like they're trying to get a default judgment against you. So if you want to try to cert like, if you wanna try to get that stopped, you have two options. Hire a lawyer immediately and get them to oppose the default if they can. If not, you may wanna try to get negotiations set up quickly to be like, listen.\n\nI am more than happy to pay if you're willing to work with me. Just, you know, let me do these, you know, whatever. Like I said, you can try to liquidate as much as you can from the company to try to get things started. Because even if even if you were able to just liquidate the 20,000 and then put that as a down payment, they may accept that to extend the timeline of payment, you know, or to at least stop this for now. But, yeah, I would say either not even either.\n\nI'd say both, actually, if you can get negotiations going because you can reach out to their attorneys and be like, hey. I wanna try to settle this as much as I can. I don't have the money right now anyway, but, like, I wanna work with you guys. Just try to be as, like show that a a willingness to be helpful is very good. Don't necessarily, like, bravo.\n\nDon't be like, no. Please. Like, don't you know? But just be like, listen. I really wanna try to do this amicably.\n\nPlease, you know, help me with this. And definitely get in contact with an attorney in Virginia too to say, like, I need help with this now because they may be able to open up negotiations too. They may have connections with these people or they may know someone that does. I don't know. You may also be able to find, what was I gonna say?\n\nYou may also be able to with the attorney, they may be able to fight the default judgment. There's no guarantee, but they could at least try a a 12, well, a motion to set aside the default. But that's it's hard to say at this point because I don't know enough of the facts to know if they have something to be able to do that successfully. But if nothing else, negotiations can and should happen right away. I'm looking let me see.\n\nI'm just looking to see if there's anything I can get you to start with to help you. Can I borrow that one more time just to see what the law office is because I don't want to recommend what or, like, you know, try to find one and then find out that it's the exact ones that are representing them because they can't help you if that's the case? That would be\n\nSpeaker 2: silly.\n\nSpeaker 0: What's the heck of a name? Okay. It doesn't look like that's the one. Okay. There's that.\n\nI found a few I mean, I I this is just me doing a couple quick like, a quick search because I don't while I actually do know some for some attorneys in Virginia, they do family law stuff. I went to law school in Virginia, so that's why I have, like yeah. So that was funny that that was the thing. I was like, oh, I actually know some people. But all the ones that I know that are working in Virginia still, they do family law or other things.\n\nThey're not in this kind of stuff. But what I did basically was and if you want, you can make a picture of whatever I found. It's just these are just the simple ones. But all I did was say, debt collection defense attorneys around Hanover County, Virginia. And when I did, these were some of the ones that popped up.\n\nSo these are some of the attorneys' offices that could potentially help you. So, like, if you wanna take a picture of that result Yeah. And then on your own, like I said, if you just try debt collection defense attorneys around Hanover County, Virginia. That should probably be one of the better problems to try to find something. But yeah.\n\nSo that's what I I highly recommend today. Trying to reach out to one of them, they are two hours ahead. So right now, it's 03:00 there just as, like, a just as a point of, like, hey. You know? Yeah.\n\nAnd then, honestly, if you could even reach out to one of them and then just say, like, I don't like, I if if I could just get help with negotiation or if whatever. If you guys can oppose this default judgment, that'd be great. But, like, I just I need whatever help you can give me at this point. And then, you know, they should be able to go from there. But Okay.\n\nI'm sorry I couldn't do more. I wish I could. No. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good. Thank you very much for helping me. Yeah. We were him a starting point. You know?\n\nYeah. I didn't even know us in Virginia.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That was a heck of a thing. Oh, that's the thing too. Sometimes with some of the legal things, even if even if you read it, you don't always catch it, I guess. Yeah.\n\nBecause when you're not in all of the legal stuff, like, it doesn't, like, it's just not what you deal with, so you just don't look for certain things. But, also, like, I assume, and forgive me for this assumption, English is not your first language. Correct? It isn't. No.\n\nExactly. So, like, even with that, like, you may be able to speak and read English, but there still may be just some things where you're reading it and it's, like, just not registering the way that it would, like, if you're reading in Spanish. Mhmm. K. So, like, if you're reading in Spanish, like, you get it immediately because it's just whatever.\n\nSo it may be that when you whenever you read something, it just didn't process the way it would normally. You know? And so it's just like, I think I understand this. What I do know is I need to go talk to a lawyer because I don't understand the law and all this other stuff. So it's easy to miss some of that sometimes.\n\nSo I I get you. So well, I wish you the best of luck.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I'm sorry I couldn't do more. I wish the\n",

The consultation revealed a jurisdictional issue - the case was filed in Virginia while the consultation occurred in a different state where Marshall isn't licensed to practice.\n\nMarshall effectively explained complex legal concepts regarding business liability, guarantor obligations, and potential negotiation strategies. His explanation of liquidating business assets before personal assets showed strategic thinking: \"What I would recommend first is trying to get as much money out of the business as you can, legitimately.\"\n\nThe attorney displayed strong empathy when addressing the client's primary concern: \"I don't wanna be homeless.\" Marshall provided practical options including negotiation strategies: \"Some creditors are willing to settle for a lesser amount because they'd rather get some money than no money.\"\n\nWhen discovering the jurisdictional issue, Marshall pivoted effectively, providing immediate value by researching Virginia attorneys and offering search strategies. His professional presence remained confident throughout, maintaining client trust despite being unable to represent him.\n\nThe consultation's critical turning point came when Marshall identified the forum selection clause in the contract. Rather than ending the consultation, he provided actionable next steps: \"Hire a lawyer immediately and get them to oppose the default if they can\" and \"get negotiations set up quickly.\"\n\nImprovement opportunities include faster document review and earlier identification of jurisdictional issues. Overall, Marshall delivered significant value despite being unable to represent the client directly."

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Two kids under 18. Ages 16 and 6. Own a home. John build the home with his mother, and mom lives there. John has promised to keep mom in the home until she passes away. Tara and John are both on title to the home. Mom asked to be taken off so that John's siblings would have a harder time claiming it. Mom is 82 years old - has COPD. Doing pretty well. Tara has asked for the home and would pay out equity to John and his mom. Owe just under $200K on the house. Tax assessment is about $600K. John thinks the easiest thing would be to sell the house and have everybody go their separate ways. Biggest concerns are child support and alimony and house. Tara works for her mom, taking care of grandma. $30 per hour - $1800 per month. Tara is underemployed. She could be working full time. She just started a new job at a little art shop, but she works for free because they let her put her art up for sale. She hasn't sold any art. Tara is also trying to start up two businesses - art businesses. Tara has purchased a lot of inventory to try to start the businesses. John makes $4800 per month, managing the produce department of a grocery department, including quarterly bonuses, which are not guaranteed. Tara has asked for child support of $269 per month and $715 per month in alimony for 21 years.\n\nJennie gave John the link to the court website where he can get the form to file an answer pro se. It doesn't look like Tara is trying to be nasty, but she is underemployed. Jennie gave John some pointers about things he could include in his answer, and he is going to try to file it pro se. He will return if he feels like he needs to hire an attorney, but this is a low income, low asset divorce and the parties will do best to get it resolved through stipulation. \n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Here is a detailed summary of the conversation between Ryan Nelson and Jeff Johnston:\nOverview:\n\\- This was a 30-minute consultation regarding a $300,000 lawsuit that Jeff Johnston's construction company, JRj Construction LLC, is facing. \n\\- The lawsuit was filed by a client named Betty Ann Curtis, and Jeff has already gone through two previous attorneys in the case.\n\\- The key issues discussed include the project delays and financial difficulties, potential insurance claims, the lack of a clear legal strategy from the previous attorneys, and the current status of the case.\nPreliminary Discussion:\n\\- Ryan explained that the conversation would be recorded for quality control and note-taking purposes, but would be covered under attorney-client privilege.\n\\- Jeff provided some initial details about the $300,000 lawsuit related to a construction project.\nProject Delays and Financial Issues:\n\\- Jeff explained that the client, Betty Ann Curtis, was late on her financing for 5-6 months, which put the entire project under stress. \n\\- Jeff had a $50,000 deposit that was used up trying to keep the project progressing, but the contract stipulated it should have been kept until the end.\n\\- Jeff believes there are only a few valid items in the lawsuit, and there are about $120,000 in outstanding invoices owed to him.\nInsurance and Legal Strategy:\n\\- Jeff is interested in exploring whether Betty Ann Curtis made a claim on the builders risk/course of construction insurance policy, as he believes she may have \"double-dipped\" by also suing him.\n\\- Ryan explained that generally, one cannot recover damages from both a lawsuit and an insurance payout, as that would be \"double-dipping.\"\nPrevious Legal Representation:\n\\- Jeff's first attorney, Liz Butler from Parsons Behle & Latimer, was competent but did not provide a clear legal strategy or case presentation.\n\\- The second attorney, Craig Wallace, was unwilling to pursue certain discovery requests or the insurance claim issue.\nCurrent Status and Next Steps:\n\\- Ryan reviewed the case docket, which showed a counterclaim had been filed by Jeff's previous attorneys, as well as a motion for sanctions.\n\\- Ryan outlined the firm's standard retainer of $12,500 for a tier 3 lawsuit of this size, and noted that some of the retainer may need to be used to address issues from the previous representation.\n\\- Jeff agreed to the retainer and hourly rates, and requested that the agreement be sent to him to review and make payment from two different accounts.\nOverall, the conversation focused on understanding the key issues in the case, Jeff's previous legal representation, and the next steps for Ryan Nelson's firm to potentially take over the defense of the lawsuit.\n",

        "Consult Transcript (Claude)": "Based on the dialogue analysis, I'll proceed with the consultation summary:\n\n# Consultation Summary\n\n## Overview\nThe consultation focused on updating estate planning documents for Derek and Britney Cox. The primary purpose was to modify their trust and related documents to change successor trustees from Devon/Sherlyn Cox to Rick and Edie Cox (Derek's parents), with Dustin Davidson as an alternate. The meeting also covered updates to personal representative designations and guardian appointments.\n\n## Action Items\n1. Update trust documents:\n- Replace Devon/Sherlyn Cox with Rick and Edie Cox as successor trustees\n- Add Dustin Davidson as alternate trustee\n1. Create new wills for both Derek and Britney:\n- Update personal representative designations\n- Modify guardian appointments\n1. Review and update certification of trust\n2. Cross out previous successor trustee names on existing documents\n3. Scan and provide digital copies of all updated documents\n4. Shred or dispose of outdated documents\n\n## Insights\n- Trust assets are distributed equally among children when they reach age 25\n- Trustee has discretion to make distributions for health, education, support, maintenance, and welfare\n- Powers of attorney should be kept private unless needed\n- Keeping estate documents in a safe deposit box or gun safe is not recommended\n- Digital assets and crypto should be made accessible to trustees\n- Making the trust the beneficiary of 401k, IRAs, and life insurance simplifies asset transfer\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Attorney to finalize and scan all updated documents\n2. Clients to:\n- Review updated documents\n- Consider updating beneficiary designations on financial accounts\n- Maintain accessible records of account information\n- Share relevant information with trustees as needed\n\n## Questions Discussed\n1. Role and powers of trustees\n2. Distribution age requirements (25 years)\n3. Co-trustee arrangements\n4. Personal representative vs. successor trustee roles\n5. Power of attorney implications\n6. Digital asset management\n7. Account accessibility after death\n\n## Timeline\n- Original trust signed: 08/25/2022\n- Current consultation: Updates to be completed same day\n- Distribution timeline: Children receive funds at age 25\n- Future review suggested: In approximately 3 years\n\n## Conclusion\nThe consultation successfully updated key estate planning documents to reflect the clients' current wishes. The new arrangement provides clear succession of trustee responsibilities to Rick and Edie Cox, with Dustin Davidson as an alternate. The documents maintain the existing distribution structure while ensuring proper management and oversight of assets. All changes were completed and witnessed during the consultation, with digital copies to be provided to the clients.\n",

Consultation Overview\nThis consultation involved updating estate planning documents for Derek and Britney Cox, specifically changing successor trustees in their trust and personal representatives in their wills. Attorney Chris efficiently identified the clients' needs and completed the document updates during the one-hour consultation. The session focused primarily on technical document changes rather than relationship building or comprehensive estate planning review. The consultation flow was somewhat fragmented, with the attorney working on document updates while maintaining conversation, but ultimately achieved the clients' immediate objectives.\n\n### 2. Attorney Performance Analysis\n\n**Expertise Demonstration:**\nChris demonstrated solid technical knowledge of estate planning documents and processes. He effectively explained legal concepts like per stirpes distribution: \"So per stirpes means in equal shares... if one of your kids were to pass away, but they had kids, then whatever interest your kid would have is then divided.\" His explanation of trustee fiduciary duties was clear and accessible: \"Trustees have what's called a fiduciary duty. So if something like that were to happen, then your kids would have recourse.\"\n\n**Sales Technique Evaluation:**\nThe attorney missed opportunities to build deeper rapport and demonstrate additional value. While he completed the requested document updates, he didn't explore whether the clients might benefit from other estate planning services. When discussing powers of attorney, he provided good advice but didn't fully explore the clients' needs: \"Powers of attorney become much more important later on... honestly, can be very, very dangerous because what they say is anyone with that document whose name's on that document can do anything on your behalf from the minute it's signed.\"\n\n**Professional Presence Assessment:**\nChris maintained a professional demeanor throughout the consultation. He demonstrated confidence in his knowledge and efficiently managed the document preparation process. His communication was generally clear, though at times the conversation became scattered while working on documents. He showed good adaptability when the clients requested additional changes beyond their initial request: \"As long as we're here, we might as well whatever changes we got, let's get them done.\"\n\n**Client Engagement Analysis:**\nThe attorney maintained adequate engagement with clients throughout the consultation. He confirmed understanding at key points and answered questions clearly. The clients appeared comfortable and satisfied with the service. Chris effectively used witnesses to complete document execution during the consultation: \"I grabbed snagged a couple people so we have witnesses so we can get it all taken care of in one shot for you.\"\n\n### 3. Critical Moments Analysis\nA key turning point occurred when Chris identified that the clients needed more changes than initially requested. He proactively suggested: \"Let's make sure because these should say...\" which led to a more comprehensive document update. When discussing document storage, Chris provided valuable advice: \"Don't ever put it in a safe or a safe deposit box... more than once I've had kids come to me and say, 'hey, do you have a copy of dad's trust?' and I said, 'no, why?' 'Well, it's in his gun safe, and we don't have the key.'\" This practical guidance demonstrated his experience and built credibility.\n\n### 4. Retention Analysis\nThis consultation involved completing specific document updates rather than retaining for ongoing representation. The attorney successfully completed all requested changes during the session. The clients appeared satisfied with the service provided. Chris missed an opportunity to discuss future estate planning needs or establish a follow-up schedule for regular document reviews. When the client asked about getting a digital copy, Chris readily agreed: \"We can scan the whole thing. Now we're gonna get it sent back to you,\" demonstrating good client service.\n\n### 5. Improvement Recommendations\n1. Implement a structured consultation opening to establish rapport and set clear expectations\n2. Create a comprehensive estate planning checklist to ensure all client needs are explored\n3. Develop a follow-up system to maintain client relationships after document updates\n4. Prepare a brief value proposition statement explaining the benefits of regular estate plan reviews\n5. Improve document management workflow to reduce time spent searching for specific provisions\n\n### 6. Comparative Analysis\nThe attorney demonstrated good technical competence compared to industry standards but could improve in relationship development. The consultation successfully achieved the immediate objective of document updates but missed opportunities for deeper client engagement and future planning. Chris's practical advice about document storage and accessibility reflects best practices in estate planning. The consultation would benefit from a more structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential client needs."

        "Transcript Paragraphs Transcript": "\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So like I said, my name is Chris. I'm one of the attorneys here at Hepworth. I do estate planning law. So, everything we talk about today is protected by attorney client privilege.\n\nWhatever we need to discuss, we can. Feel free to share anything we need to. Looking at the note, it looks like You're not that good. Looking at the note, it looks like there needs to be, an update to the successor trustee. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So we have successor. It says I nominate Devon Cox as successor. K. And they spelled it wrong over here.\n\nThey\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Devon. But we're changing anywhere where Devon's a successor to Rick and Edie Cox. Okay. Which is my parents. Essentially.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. I think I hope it's pretty straightforward. I mean\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Is it something that we could do in the hour, like, get it printed and signed and everything? Or\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think we should be able to. Let me see. In fact, let me see if I can find the original trust because if we can, then it's k. So much easier.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I need the name. Let's see. Trust. Find and replace.\n\nYeah. Okay. So over here. Derek and Britney. See if I can find this in here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Derek Cox right there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then just because I have to ask, you guys are Derek and Britney. Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: K. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: 21\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Just gotta make sure you're not in here trying to, you know Impersonate. Yeah. Update someone else's trust.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who has the time for that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you unfortunately, you'd be surprised.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And it is TV show. Credentials. TV show, like, wrinkle show. Yeah.\n\nHave you ever been part of that?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. That was good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure you've seen some some crazy stuff, though.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. They get they get weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can Lots of weird\n\nSpeaker 0: lots of weird things happen. So so the wills and everything, are we revising everything or just the trust?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Everything would be Kennedy where it has Devon.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if it is a find and replace, there's Deb yeah. Deb on. Well, there's a different name for him.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And\n\nSpeaker 1: We can search for both. Yeah. Search for that. I would search for both.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Perfect. Let\n\nSpeaker 1: me let me do this. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought we were saying that, but then in the document, we ended up giving us.\n\nSpeaker 0: And it was signed 08/25/2022?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. August 25. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait. So this still has\n\nSpeaker 1: that in here. Yeah. He's just gonna change that. Are you sure?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Devin Cox and oh, and Sherlyn. So Okay. There's also Sherlyn. So there's a Devin Cox and Sherlyn Cox. We're changing s h I\n\nSpeaker 0: r l y n?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. K. That's pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, and we have Dustin as the alternate? Yeah. So it'll be Rick and Edie Cox with Dustin if they're not available. Right. Oh, I like that.\n\nThat's Rick and Can we do Dustin in?\n\nSpeaker 0: Is it\n\nSpeaker 1: e is e y e y. D I e.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then\n\nSpeaker 2: No. Might be too hard.\n\nSpeaker 0: There was a so I've got so we're gonna replace Devon or Devon Yeah. And Sherlyn with Rick and Edy Cox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then what other changes were we making?\n\nSpeaker 1: This one says Devon Cox and Cheerleader. Okay. With Rick and Cox. And then I mean, is there a place in here that says our assets are distributed evenly between the kits, or is it just in the trust?\n\nSpeaker 0: So it should be in the trust and Actually,\n\nSpeaker 1: the the Can you\n\nSpeaker 0: take it And say if you have the trust, let's let's just make sure because these should say\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the what are the The executor decides how to distribute until they're 18, I guess, I think.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So that sends it to the trust. So those are good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now let's make sure the trust says where it needs to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, the will sends it to the trust, and then the trust\n\nSpeaker 0: says Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. How it's distributed. Okay. So under 21.\n\nSpeaker 0: K. Yeah. As long as as long as we're here, we might as well whatever changes we got, let's\n\nSpeaker 1: we got an hour.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's get them done. Conners, clients. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's Katie and Brian. Disposition. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the way it's written right now is everything will come into the trust, and then it will be divided into as many equal shares as there are children that are living.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And children of ours, let me see. So if there's okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So it'll be however many kids you guys have, it'll be divided into that many portions, and they'll each get that amount of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And does that is that when they're 21 or is that when they're 18?\n\nSpeaker 0: So it looks like 25. But the trustee then can make payments, as they deem necessary for health education, support maintenance, and welfare. So, a lot of times, we see\n\nSpeaker 1: this as Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: The trustee could pay for college or for\n\nSpeaker 1: For a semester in college. Yeah. They can pay it out in chunks.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So the trust and, basically, all this says is, you know, a lot of times you don't wanna give depending on the value, you know, you don't wanna give a 19 year old Yeah. 3 quarters of a million dollars and say Have fun. You use it wisely. You know?\n\nYeah. So this is just kinda the trustee has the ability to To manage. Spend whatever they you know, if it's like, hey. I'm going to school and, you know, you're living here in Bountiful. I'm going to BYU.\n\nI need a car. The trustee would have the discretion to say, okay. Yeah. We can get you a\n\nSpeaker 1: car. Does the trustee, would they have, like, unlimited access to the accounts to just\n\nSpeaker 0: The trustee. Pay out whatever? Or do you have to go through So your kids would have to go through the trustee who then would decide is this a reasonable, you know, request.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we trust our trustee.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and that's that's really what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're not gonna be like, oh, you need a house? Definitely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And they're not just taking it\n\nSpeaker 0: and Right. In a\n\nSpeaker 1: car for themselves.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and with that, you know, trustees have what's called a fiduciary duty. So if something like that were to happen, then your kids would have recourse to then say, hey. You took our money. Yeah.\n\nYou need to give it back. You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there for wills, is there, like, anything, like, with, like, second pair of eyes trustee or, like, someone that, like, they can each check Yeah. So you can you can\n\nSpeaker 0: you can set it up to have, what are called co trustees, which are basically two people\n\nSpeaker 1: checking on each other.\n\nSpeaker 0: And you can do that a couple different ways. Sometimes it's a matter of these two people have equal. And so whichever one you go to, a lot of times what it actually is is if there's gonna be a distribution, they have to agree that's in the best interest. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know. We can leave it. Do you have something coming to you? I don't know. Do we wanna save\n\nSpeaker 2: I Dustin, though. I do trust him. But\n\nSpeaker 1: K. We'll leave it Dustin for now. K. We can always change it in a couple years.\n\nSpeaker 0: K. So then I think with that, if that all sounds like you So I do most of the job\n\nSpeaker 1: at one trustee.\n\nSpeaker 0: Generally. Yeah. Unless there's unless there's either a specific reason. Mhmm. You know, I really want\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I've seen it where, you know, I really want my mom to do it, but she's getting kinda old. And so let's maybe have someone else that can kinda make sure she's not\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, they would probably\n\nSpeaker 0: Put in you know? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: They would see when they look at the bank account.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where did this $25,000 Yeah. Just disappear? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Most of the time, it comes in not any kind of, like, malfeasance. It's generally more of, like, you know, grandma's the trustee and gets forgetful, and all of a sudden, there's an extra zero added on to something. And it's like, you know, my $5,000 car now became $50,000 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I think that's it. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Just so we're just changing Devin and Sherlyn with Rick and Edie. Yeah. Rick and Edie. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then there are some places where it just has Devon's name. Mhmm. I'm not sure why.\n\nSpeaker 0: And that's and yeah. So it'll it will go through, and we'll make sure once we get it all done that it's actually Okay. Catching it all and nothing worse than\n\nSpeaker 1: And, do you need do you got Rick's name, r I c k I Yeah. And then Edie's hard one. Yeah. Some people spell it like Edie. Twenty five.\n\nI think 25 is good. Yeah. I remember we number three.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and that is a pretty standard. 25 is usually a pretty standard one.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then I really I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2: our parents didn't give us\n\nSpeaker 1: a bunch of money before even '25. Yeah. I like this, the education and health. Yeah. Support, maintenance, and welfare.\n\nShe'll be added to the principal.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So we're gonna replace Devon Cox as successor trustee, and we'll update the certificate of trust to reflect that. The wills are gonna be replaced as guardians and personal representatives.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Isn't that persecutes I\n\nSpeaker 1: think means to their children? To their children. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 0: So so per stirpes means in equal shares.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, in equal shares. So To make of a deceased child had a child.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So so if, you know, one of your kids were to pass away, but they had kids, then whatever interest your kid would have is then divided. Yeah. Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's I mean, you know, made this. So this is\n\nSpeaker 0: we're\n\nSpeaker 1: just understanding how it works.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Absolutely. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: We look dark in this.\n\nSpeaker 0: It is it is a very Different language. It's a very interesting Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just remember hearing that. My dad's died since we did this. Yeah. So I've heard some of these things. Would it be possible to do one thing online?\n\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I will couldn't we get Dustin Davidson as my personal representative if it's not\n\nSpeaker 1: Derek? Yeah. Is that a big deal?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Everything what is a personal representative? What is what does that mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I die, then you are the guy. But if you're not available, then it would be Devin right now. And I think I prefer it\n\nSpeaker 1: to be Dustin. I kinda wanna Okay. Who were you seeing? Well, I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is mine. Me, personally. But this is his sister.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you so if Why is it Devin? So what does the successor mean on the will?\n\nSpeaker 0: So so the personal representative is if there's and the only time the will really becomes relevant in if where you guys have a trust is if something's found that's not already in the trust. The personal representative is the one who's appointed by the court in probate to basically gather that and put it in the trust. So\n\nSpeaker 2: But the trust is hopefully eliminating\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Yeah. The the only time probate, like I said, is if something and it usually happens if there's something that you know, it frankly, it's usually purchased after. Something after the trust and, you know, you guys forget to actually title it in the name of the trust. You see it you see it a lot with, like, cars Mhmm.\n\nWhere, you know, you get a new car, and it's in your guys' personal name rather than as trustees of the trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think all our cars are in our personal name.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which is totally fine, but that's where, you know\n\nSpeaker 1: He comes in.\n\nSpeaker 0: The personal representative would go to probate and say, hey, judge. Here's this. Make me the personal representative, and then signs them all over to the trustee, and then that's the end of it. K. The successor per provision is if that's required and, like, on yours, Brit, if Derek, if you're unavailable for some reason\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Then the successor would be the next person in line to be that personal representative.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I kinda wanna do Dustin as well for mine.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: For just so, like Just for that part. So, like, my like, Rick and Edie to, like, would Care for that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Care for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then Dustin would be the, like, what is it? Not the successor, but The representative. The representative.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that okay?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. K.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So let me we've got the amendment to the trust done. Full full. You know? I thought it would work with Dustin, but, you know\n\nSpeaker 0: And and I will say, sometimes that is best to not have kind of all the eggs in one basket Yeah. Just in case. You know? It's not normally an issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thinking at.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's not normally an issue, but you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: You hope people have Yeah. Best interest. Yeah. But sometimes they don't.\n\nSpeaker 0: But certainly, when when probate disputes happen, they are some of the ugliest. And so if we can avoid them, let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for catching that. Because I thought Devin was just I thought he was just just for them. Okay. So Marcus, I said, you and then Katie and Brian. But, I mean, I guess, he would have to figure out how to get by and address.\n\nYeah. Let's just hope that ever\n\nSpeaker 0: love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Talking about if\n\nSpeaker 2: me and dad a day. What'd you say, babe? It's uncomfortable. I think it's less uncomfortable because we've done it before. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 1: I see. And you're not as baby babies. That might be part of it. Yeah. There's there's there's still There's still a little bit\n\nSpeaker 0: of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if there's anything, like, you see when you're looking through that, it's like, this is weird. Like, let us know all weekend. Like\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I actually you know, from reading it as I've gone through it so far, it's Yeah. Pretty pretty straightforward. You know, sometimes they get sometimes trust can get pretty weird. Mhmm.\n\nBut your guys' is is pretty pretty straightforward. So that's That's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Boring in a good way.\n\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. When I say they get weird and complicated, it's usually not a not a good thing that has happened to get us to that point. So\n\nSpeaker 1: So and then all of, like, my bank accounts and stuff, I'm, like, not being here. So, like, if they get this document, they don't have that, and they know where to go. Look. Yeah. Is that kinda recommended?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think that's a a great way to handle it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like, here's the life insurance policy. Here's a policy number. Here's\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. In fact, one of the there's a I don't know if Tyler talked about them when you there is a kind of program and a set of documents that you can get that basically deals with kind of all of those thing. And it's like a\n\nSpeaker 2: right now what?\n\nSpeaker 0: Kind of. And it has, you know, places where you can put in, here's all the bank account numbers, and here's nowadays, here's the passwords to my various things, and here's so some of those kind of things are pretty helpful if they're you know? The last thing, you know, you want don't want someone to say, hey. I think I think I was supposed to do this, but I can't find the password to this. And then it's like, oh, well, k.\n\nI guess we can try to negotiate with you know? We had a someone who we ended up having to negotiate with Amazon to basically get mom's passwords to so they could cancel the Amazon account and just very it can get very weird. So\n\nSpeaker 2: My mom had to fight really hard Oh, for the\n\nSpeaker 1: for things that were called joint accounts.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And she's like, how is this happening?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's a very weird weird situation sometimes. So\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like shared.\n\nSpeaker 1: Shared. I'm hoping at minimum, like, they'll know, like, the bank and the account. They can call and provide death certificate or whatever. You know?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was kinda weird how unprepared it felt like people were to receive those calls. It's like, doesn't this happen all the time? Like\n\nSpeaker 0: You would think, but somewhat I mean, banks especially seem to be completely confused that that might be a thing they have to deal with. Or they always then, oh, well make\n\nSpeaker 1: it difficult Yeah. To save them. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Or you get the occasional one who wants to try to well, I don't know if they had any of this financial planning, but we can help do this. And it's like, We don't need That that is literally the last thing that is needed right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sounds like a good plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I forgot who\n\nSpeaker 1: the wording of this is coming. Hang on. I came home and\n\nSpeaker 2: I forgot it was happening. I think it's too complicated to name two people that aren't married\n\nSpeaker 1: and weren't obligated to each other. We should have done that. Yeah. Like, I feel like Michelle would maybe volunteer. She's gonna work with him.\n\nYeah. But, like, you can't. But he was, like, the leader. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Plus, if we do wanna\n\nSpeaker 1: do this again in, like, three ish years But this would be right in the Yeah. Best And then Guardians. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And on the personal representatives, instead of Devin, we were putting\n\nSpeaker 1: Dustin,\n\nSpeaker 0: d n\n\nSpeaker 1: s t a n k.\n\nSpeaker 2: Davidson, d a b I d\n\nSpeaker 1: s o n. Okay. For both genders.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then\n\nSpeaker 1: And two dot eight?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then two c u would be. Yeah. Rick and e d. And then we're leaving.\n\nDustin is the alternate. Okay. I like that too because then they can't.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, we get behind on our. Yeah. And that's already.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I still kinda don't like. Okay. Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 0: While we get ready for that one, let me see if this first one printed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. What? If we end right on time, it's fourteen minutes. If we end as long as the meeting was on hour, it's, like, thirty minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Katie, why don't you play or listen to It's not really K. See if I can get this\n\nSpeaker 0: to print. We'll be on our way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need a hold on. What? I know. That shouldn't be the 20% at the end of work day. It's just because it's getting older.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why it's\n\nSpeaker 0: not printing this. If I send you these documents, will you print them for me? Just one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Probably if you\n\nSpeaker 1: Kinda cool. Just nurse it for a bit. Is that the next one that you have your No. This is 6. O, 7.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's the one you have your eyes on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I think these\n\nSpeaker 1: may have been your attempts, but I have two. Do you wanna just check to see if they're both the same? Those\n\nSpeaker 0: are them.\n\nSpeaker 1: They are? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Those are them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I will just just, try this other one, but I will grab it.\n\nSpeaker 0: And there's that. Thank you. Just decided to take its time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do we just replace that specific feature in here?\n\nSpeaker 0: So what it'll be is this this is the amendment to the trust. So you guys can just put this kind of on top. Mhmm. So, basically, what it says is, you know, you'll read it. Everything in the trust is still valid except to see These\n\nSpeaker 2: are our changes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. To see of the trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: May I just\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And let's absolutely. Let's make sure that we're Two c Two c three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three.\n\nSpeaker 0: In the event that both of us cease to act for any reason, we should be succeeded by Rick Cox and Edie Cox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: As trustees.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then on the cert on the certification of trust, which is a document towards the back, and if I missed, that's the only place I found him in the trust itself because normal normally, it says trustee after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that okay? That that doesn't say that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So, normally, they say in the beginning, these are the trustees are, and then everywhere else through there, it says our trustee will do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, our trustee. Okay. That makes it nice. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So then in the I think it's a couple pages after that. It's called the certification of trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trust certification.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So that document, basically, all that says is there's a section that says successor trustees, which is just trustee right there. Trustees. In the event that both Derek Cox and Britney Cox cease to act for any reason, they shall be succeeded by Rick Cox and Edie Cox. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can we, like, just stretch his name out? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: To make it more clear?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So you guys, what we'll do when we sign this is we'll go through and we'll cross it out, and you can actually write c first amendment. Oh. And that way and then it'll just refer back to this document. And then the wills will actually do whole new wills that those ones you can take out, and we'll put new ones in.\n\nSo there's no\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you\n\nSpeaker 0: so much. Question. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, Crystal, want me to grab into you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Give me just a few minutes. But yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then I grabbed snagged a couple people so we have witnesses so we can get it all all taken care of in one shot for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's nice to\n\nSpeaker 2: you need our, like, driver's license or anything?\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, if I was if I was a notary that was concerned, I might. But\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. We look like\n\nSpeaker 2: You look like a jerk.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I I trust you guys are who you claim to be. You you can tell me what's going on in your trust, so I have no reason to believe it's not your trust.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. One time so for our honeymoon, we went to I don't know. Was it Barbados? Anyway, we were, like, trying to get back in The United States, and his passport picture for was was from when he was a teenager.\n\nSpeaker 0: And so the guy\n\nSpeaker 2: was just staring at him, like, for a long time, and I, like, started laughing because it it seemed silly to me. And then\n\nSpeaker 1: he glared at you. He glared at me. I was like, oh, man. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: If it if it makes you and then let me just make sure. We have Brian Cox and Katie Cox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. Perfect. You.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm. Yep. And then this final disposition Mhmm. We update that too?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. K. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who do you want this to be?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure what this\n\nSpeaker 1: one is. Just sort of nice, I think for final disposition, like, burial Oh, what to do with us? Yeah. What to do with us. I think Dustin would be Not Dustin.\n\nThat's up\n\nSpeaker 2: to your mom. She's putting us right next to her. She'd probably say put him in the same hole as me. That'd be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a good problem to be wanted so much. Yeah. Yeah. I\n\nSpeaker 2: don't mind it, like, this way or,\n\nSpeaker 0: like, this way\n\nSpeaker 1: or, like, this way? Or, like, this way? Yeah. Like, the front half. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I feel like cremation\n\nSpeaker 1: would maybe be better for me at that point.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want them to turn me into a big diamond.\n\nSpeaker 0: This reminds me of when I have to bring my daughter to work with me and she dad, when are we gonna be done?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're like, I'm gonna get there.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: She's not the same one. Oh, tell me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: She's eight. Oh, it's\n\nSpeaker 2: she's turning eight on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like Fun. Yeah. There.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. She's at the perfect age to know exactly what she doesn't like to do in my case. So\n\nSpeaker 1: You're right. I'm driving.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's secrets. So that Yeah. He rid us this one. He rid us this one. No other amendments.\n\nOkay. Perfect. And\n\nSpeaker 0: what and what I will say is is uncomfortable and as unfun as it is, it's better to do this now. Yeah. This morning, I was at a, hospice facility helping someone sign it, like, as so it\n\nSpeaker 1: This isn't what you gotta be thinking about.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Exactly. This is hard on your That's not the time you wanna be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, trying to me me standing over your bed going, hey. What what are we doing about this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because your mental state too might be\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Not as\n\nSpeaker 2: I first\n\nSpeaker 1: when my dad died, I was like, couldn't make any decision. You know?\n\nSpeaker 0: Who was that? Some random people walking in and out far off. I don't know who these people are.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that makes for a heavy day even for you. I'm sorry. I'm late too.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. You're fine. Like I said, I'd much rather be, you know, having having planning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Chilling in the conference\n\nSpeaker 0: room. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then on the, final disposition document, there's a couple ways. I we can certainly do a whole new one if you guys want. But that one Yeah. That says Devon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: That has Devon in the middle. Yeah. So we can certainly do another one if you guys want just for the peace of mind. But that one, you can also we can cross out, and you can write in who it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I find\n\nSpeaker 0: And then, you know, if you guys if you guys initial it and then, you know, if we need to, I can put a notary stamp at the bottom. We do that sometimes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So That would yeah. That would\n\nSpeaker 0: work. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we can yeah. If it's official.\n\nSpeaker 0: K. Perfect. Yeah. We'll I\n\nSpeaker 1: just don't wanna be, like Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Writing things on napkins. I don't know Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good. I don't know what this power of attorney is. It says name of his accessory agent. Utah statutory form.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the power of attorney is, if something happens and you need someone to speak on your behalf, so that one, we can we can replace those as well if we need to. Yeah. Let's\n\nSpeaker 1: not. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. His\n\nSpeaker 1: name's all over the place. So\n\nSpeaker 0: And that's usually that's usually what it is is kind of the same people are throughout. So but, yeah, we can\n\nSpeaker 1: One says Devin and one says Devon. I don't know how they So So Britney says Devon. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not showing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this one, we want to be Dustin, a power of attorney. K. To be Dustin. Right? Yeah.\n\nK. Okay. Let me see\n\nSpeaker 0: if this is if this guy's printing. Okay. So here's the updated will for you, Derek. Okay. So Britney is your wife.\n\nYou have Brian and Katie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: You have a trust. Mhmm. The biggest ones is so Britney will be personal representative. If she's unavailable, then Dustin Davidson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Okay. Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then we've got Guardians. So Rick and Edie\n\nSpeaker 1: Or the card\n\nSpeaker 0: or the Guardians. Yeah. And then if if both of them are unavailable, then Dustin.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 0: So so we gotta go Britney, Rick, and Edie, and then we'll get to Dustin on Guardians.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Awesome. This is great.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then it's quite a bit smaller. A lot of the stuff in your guys' other wills is not necessary. It's just\n\nSpeaker 1: More words.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Ultimately, what it is is, you know, distribution of the estate, pay expenses. If there's retirement accounts, you know, you guys will give each other those interests, and then everything else, send to the trust. K. And that's if the trust is not in effect, then what it will do, testamentary trust mirroring.\n\nSo, basically, if for whatever reason, this trust isn't there, then what this says is, okay. You know, Dustin, you're gonna take and you're gonna create a trust on the exact same terms, which what that means is if your kids are 25, he's just gonna say, here you go, and that'll be the end of it. A lot of the language in the one that's currently there is this, this general powers. It's all just you have all the powers that the probate code has. That just lists them all out.\n\nSo\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's fine. I mean\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: More condensed for me is Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So this you know? And so this one four d says if you get through the whole list of personal representatives and everyone is unavailable, then the last person in line can say this person should do it. It I have never seen something get to there, but belt and suspenders. So that's that's kind of that's the terms of that. Does that all look good?\n\nMhmm. Is that the changes we needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we can literally take this out?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. So that so that will once we get these all signed, we'll just take those out. We can shred them, and those will go in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. This is mine.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. And yours will basically mirror this exactly. We'll change. And, Britney, you were married to Derek. You have the same kids.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's make sure that Oh, Dustin. Yeah. K.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm trying, man. I'm trying. Oh, you guys are fine. Yeah.\n\nOkay. So let me get those. Yeah. Okay. So if you guys wanna read through those to get make sure I got the the his and hers right on all of them.\n\nOkay. Then we needed to do updated powers of attorney.\n\nSpeaker 1: Power of attorney. And the successor would be Devin to Did we say Dustin? Well, is this he just manages the assets. So This is\n\nSpeaker 2: like if we can't speak for ourselves.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So power of attorney basically gives authority to act in any way that you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And is this Dustin? I think Dustin. Right? Because he's, like, the financial\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this already, like Part of the trust. Like, for me, like, if Derek was already unavailable, or should I put Derek?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. So Derek would be first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is Mike. Okay. It\n\nSpeaker 1: has me right here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So and this is where it gets a little bit if you guys don't necessarily want to update these, you don't have to because with everything in the trust, if something happens, your trustee is going to manage it anyway. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Oh.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, you guys do have flexibility. We can certainly redo them if you want, but they're not as as important.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I yeah. I don't know. This is weird to me. So do we what do you recommend?\n\nYou're the expert\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, honestly honestly, I tell people powers of attorney become much more important later on if it's because that's when you're getting into, do I need to manage health care decisions? Do we need to, you know, do you need to go to a memory care facility? Do you need to go? Yeah. It really and in fact, powers of attorney, honestly, can be very, very dangerous Mhmm.\n\nBecause what they say is anyone with that document whose name's on that document can do anything on your behalf from the minute it's signed. Right. So\n\nSpeaker 1: So should I not sign this and we'll just put it in the trust?\n\nSpeaker 0: So what I what I would say is, you know, if you guys are healthy, no issues, I would keep those right where they are and not tell anyone about them. And then if there is a need to update them down the road, update them down the road. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I scratch his\n\nSpeaker 0: name out? Or Yeah. Okay. Yeah. In fact, you can scratch the name out and then just initial next to it as so there is no successor trustee or just\n\nSpeaker 1: because then it would be destined Yeah. For the\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And that everything ultimately is going to default back to the trust at the end of the day. So like I said, if we have the the trust and the wills updated, that's the biggest one. And then\n\nSpeaker 1: sign\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Just put your initials. Yep. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And then it would come to me or the trust.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So if these look good, let me grab witnesses, and we'll get them signed. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: K. Do you wanna scratch this out?\n\nSpeaker 2: This might be like\n\nSpeaker 1: a portfolio package, and then it's like, let's fill it out. Hi, you guys. Hi, Mary. I'm Annie. Hi, Derek.\n\nNice to meet you, Jenny.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Britney.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nice to meet you guys. Hi, guys. We're just here to stand by and sign. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, we're gonna Yeah. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Possible.\n\nSpeaker 0: So like I said, so this one, so we're amending article two, section two. We're going to Rick and Edie, and that same thing, certification and trust. If you guys are unavailable, Rick and Edie is gonna handle it. Everything else in the trust is gonna stay the same. Yes.\n\nOkay. Perfect. What I forgot to bring in is an extra pen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I know. There's one on my desk that you just wanna put in. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Blue or does it matter?\n\nSpeaker 0: It doesn't matter. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then once we sign this, I can do Do we need\n\nSpeaker 2: to wait for\n\nSpeaker 1: a friend? Scratch it out. No. You're fine. And I can say see first amendment.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Yeah. Okay. So these these sections where it has Yeah. You know, right now where it shows, Devin or Devon.\n\nI forget which one is which at this point. No. No. But you can just cross him out and just put a little note that says see First Amendment. See First Amendment.\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so does this still recorded, like, with the state or\n\nSpeaker 0: anything? Nope.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. So you guys you all\n\nSpeaker 0: you go And the whole the whole the whole purpose of trust is the state never is aware of what's going on. So Unless you have to sue over there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which I certainly hope that I never see any of you here\n\nSpeaker 1: to sue you. The only way, like, Dustin knows about this is if I share\n\nSpeaker 0: this with them. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your discretion. Do people do that digitally or do I make copies or\n\nSpeaker 0: Up to you. I usually recommend at some point having whether it's a physical copy or a digital copy of it just in case. And then this one, don't ever put it in a safe or a safe deposit box. Yes. And the reason I say that is more than once I've\n\nSpeaker 1: had kids kids come to me and say, hey.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you have a copy of dad's trust? And I said, no. Why?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well We can't.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's it's it's in his gun safe, and we don't have the key. It's like, well, yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Get get get someone to come cut the lock out of it, I guess. Okay. So that is good to go. Like I said, you\n\nSpeaker 0: can just put that at the first page of the trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do we have three hole punch at home?\n\nSpeaker 0: Actually, we\n\nSpeaker 1: can grab it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I bet they have\n\nSpeaker 1: one or two. Well, yeah. Well, okay. Somewhere.\n\nSpeaker 0: So then, Derek, here's your will. You said it's still going to the trust. So we've got personal representative, Britney, and then Dustin Davidson. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's awesome.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then for Guardians, Britney, then we got Rick and Eddy and then Dustin as a as a resort last resort there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want me to go sit in that corner?\n\nSpeaker 0: I didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: know that was your seat. Sorry. There's one of you in the chair by full of No. You're good. There you go.\n\nSorry. Kept it working. Oh, you're you're fine.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then here, anything that's left, we're putting back in the truck. I think\n\nSpeaker 1: it comes to you now. Is this are these\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Those are stacked.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. K.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, as far as what the personal representative can get to move into the trust, digital assets is certainly the big one now. Make sure if you have crypto, make sure it's I've accessible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Has a successor option in that and I added the living trust\n\nSpeaker 0: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Name. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's and that's what I'd say. If you have four zero one k, IRAs, life insurance, the easiest way to make all of them the beneficiary, make it the trust. Okay. Because then they go in and you don't have to worry about\n\nSpeaker 1: They just show this trust document or something. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. They will send in a death certificate and a copy of the trust and say, here's the routing number. The funds just go. And that's it avoids anything there. So this one will just need your signature there.\n\nAnd then here's where these guys come in. So if you don't have offer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sign date and you can just\n\nSpeaker 1: Glad your kiddos were able to sit through it a little. Very well. Yes. I've been having your Tom Hancock forever now.\n\nSpeaker 0: Been talking about Taco Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Taco Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh. They're they're they're invested to get out of here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I now I am too. I, lived in New Mexico for a little bit, and we would pop across the border literally for taco Tuesday and then come back. And so Oh, yeah. I lived along the Rio Grande, and so it just I was on reservations. I was just in, you know, apartment complexes.\n\nBut I was in well, I was in Nogales, Arizona. Oh, Lakewood. Literally. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWe got a lot of, like, blankets and stuff. I did too. And then it was, like, a little pockets and there. There. Years ago.\n\nI got you know that also.\n\nSpeaker 0: They're they're both. I just realized. Yeah. Weirdos,\n\nSpeaker 1: join the club. I am a freak. It's fine. Two in one office. That's is that I think that's a good one.\n\nSpeaker 0: But just remember that at least you guys are still allowed to sign signatures.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So Yes. Yeah. So to avoid any confusion, we'll, like, rip this up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Or if you want, we can throw it in our shredder and yeah. We have a\n\nSpeaker 1: a month or something.\n\nSpeaker 0: We have It's\n\nSpeaker 1: old. It's an old black in my Okay. Anything else you need from me?\n\nSpeaker 0: We got one more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, one more. Okay. Perfect. Can you be too careful of these things? Sometimes there's three more.\n\nSometimes there's only one. Can we get a digital copy of this? I'd be more than happy to. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. So there's that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait. Will I have the version there?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We can we can scan the whole thing. Now we're gonna get it sent back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm a good. You guys need to be friends. Yeah. I got one more out of here.\n\nSpeaker 0: In fact, you wanna throw your signature there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this one's for you. Yes? Yes. Okay. Perfect.\n\nI'm gonna stamp this one.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then, yeah, like I said, on the disposition instructions, that one you can just cross out Devon and write and write in\n\nSpeaker 1: attorney where he did. Yeah. No. The the disposition is the burial.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Just\n\nSpeaker 1: cross it out. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: You can just cross him out and put, Dustin Davidson? Yeah. There you go. Cool. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you want to do them personally Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I might give this to you to sign. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I just initial.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I just initial.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Just initial next to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. And then if you wanna fill that out.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then yeah. We can absolutely, just go ahead and take the whole thing and we can scan in a whole copy for you so you have it just total digital copy\n\nSpeaker 1: of it as well. So Do you wanna do that one for you? Yeah. You know what? I mean, I think we could get a home.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Totally up to you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's also my job too, so I will not feel bad in this place.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you\n\nSpeaker 1: have one that'll just, like, run it through, like, like Oh, yes. Yeah. Not page by page. K. If you don't mind.\n\nMight take us a\n\nSpeaker 2: weekend project. Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We can absolutely go ahead and just scan it through. And that way you guys have one full copy of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. That's what I was looking forward to. Send it to everyone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. And then there is that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Yeah. I think that's everything.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right? Perfect. Yeah. I mean, those are the big documents we got we got Devin replaced with Probably.

It was later revealed that she had stayed past her lease termination and that the fine print of the lease said that notice was required or a month to month was assumed.

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Here is a detailed summary of the conversation, including the options discussed and decisions made:\nOptions Discussed:\n1. Jennifer could simply say she's leaving by the end of October as per their agreement, and ignore the property manager's threats. This would be the cleanest break.\n2. Jennifer could send a formal letter to the property manager outlining the verbal agreement she had with her partner, including the $1,000 monthly payments and their plan to stay until October 31st. This would provide documentation of the contract.\n3. Jennifer could try to negotiate a more comprehensive settlement agreement with her partner. This could involve her keeping the coffee shop business in exchange for walking away from the house and furnishings.\n4. If the property manager tries to evict Jennifer, she could defend herself in court by presenting the evidence of their verbal lease agreement.\nDecisions Made:\n- Jennifer decided she will primarily ignore the property manager and just inform them she is leaving by the end of October per her agreement with her partner.\n- She will gather all the text messages and other documentation as evidence of their verbal contract, in case the property manager does try to evict her.\n- Jennifer is open to the idea of a more formal settlement agreement, where she keeps the coffee shop and walks away from the house, as long as it provides a clean break.\n- She does not want to be harassed or have to physically move out before the end of October, so she will firmly stand her ground on that timeline.\n- If an eviction lawsuit is filed, Jennifer plans to defend herself in court using the evidence of their verbal lease agreement.\nThe overall goal is for Jennifer to exit the living and business arrangements with her partner as smoothly as possible by the end of October, either through their existing verbal agreement or a negotiated settlement.\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Key Points:\n1. Elliana Serrano's Background:\n2.    - Elliana is completely blind in both eyes and has a condition called anophthalmia, which causes the eyes to be smaller than normal.\n3.    - From the age of 6 months to 9 years old, her parents used conformers (plastic discs) in her eyes, which was extremely painful and traumatic.\n4.    - This led to infections, bloodshot and bloody eyes, missed school, and lasting mental health issues, including nightmares, suicidal thoughts, and a severe aversion to leaving her apartment without sunglasses.\n5. Potential Legal Claims:\n6.    - Sarah Spitzer discusses potential personal injury, emotional distress, assault, and battery claims that Elliana could pursue against her parents.\n7.    - However, the statute of limitations for these types of claims is generally around 2-4 years, which may be an issue given that the last incident occurred when Elliana was 9 years old, and she is now 23.\n8. Statute of Limitations and Tolling:\n9.    - Sarah Spitzer consults with another attorney to discuss the potential for tolling the statute of limitations, which could extend the time period for filing a lawsuit.\n10.    - The issue is that Elliana was already aware of the injury and its effects on her mental health starting around age 13, which makes it difficult to argue for tolling.\n11. Alternative Approach:\n12.    - Sarah Spitzer suggests that Elliana could contact the district attorney's office to inquire about the possibility of pursuing criminal charges against her parents, as another avenue for seeking closure and accountability.\n13.    - Elliana agrees to try contacting the district attorney's office the next day.\nIn summary, this updated detailed report provides more specific information about Elliana Serrano's background and the legal issues discussed, including the statute of limitations, tolling considerations, and the suggestion of pursuing criminal charges as an alternative approach.\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Emory is 23yo.\n\nSleep therapist had been meeting with Emory for about 3 years. Name is Laura Newman (?)\n\nWas allowed to start shifts according to accommodations.\n\nEvery new year, they have a break where they determine if they want to keep each employee. They decided in this time that they want to keep him but at the same time stopped scheduling him shifts he can accommodate.\n\nThis time, he asked for the accommodation through the board. Every time previously, he would send the request to his direct manager and he would send it to HR. He had a council meeting to determine whether he should get the accommodation, and it was very hostile. \n\nBecause of this change, have scheduled him to essentially only one or two shifts a week.\n\nTexts from supervisor (Jan. 11, after doing a week of work beginning of January) saying he was not scheduled for the next few weeks and that he needed to look at his hours restrictions because it was more difficult to schedule him.\n\nThen they later asked that he update his medical documentation. He did so, and this did not fix the issue.\n\nAlso, supervisor also told Emory that he needed to apply to the sorting plants/processing plants. But if he did that, he would lost his tenure as a PSE (permanent employee) where he is on his way to winning his status as a PSE.\n\nEmory has been working in the post office itself, but there are also processing plants with different employees that work at night.\n\nThey also want to ask for backpay of the shifts he's been deprives for not getting scheduled.\n",

I had given my direct supervisor my doctors letter to show my need for the accommodation, and was scheduled according to my request. My accommodation is that I need a delayed shift start of no earlier than 12 pm due to a documented sleep disorder.\n\nSince the new year, I have been asked to take part in an official accommodation request process. I have complied with all the requested processes. However, during this time, my shifts have been extremely limited by the station manager who claims that there are no shifts available for me at my requested time. However, the entire previous year I was working at least 32 hours a week consistently during my requested shift hours. The station manager has been exhibiting hostile behavior toward me because of my accommodation request. My direct supervisor has also exhibited hostile behavior and negative statements about my disability. \n\nI have also been told that I should start my career at USPS over entirely, which would remove my current seniority since I have only one year left before I am converted into being a career employee.\n\nanswer: Concerned about disability discrimination by the USPS\nquestion: Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting.\n\nanswer: I don't have this information at this time \nquestion: We need to clear any potential conflicts of interest.

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "The consultation was between Attorney Michael Hepworth and clients Jon and Mike Madsen, who are joint owners of Madsen Remodeling. The discussion centered around a legal dispute between Madsen Remodeling and a flooring contractor called All In One Flooring.\nThe key points are:\n1\\. Ongoing business relationship and contract dispute: Madsen Remodeling had an ongoing business relationship with All In One Flooring, where Madsen would provide jobs and All In One would handle the flooring installation. However, a dispute arose on one particular job where All In One's work was unsatisfactory, leading to a heated confrontation between Jon Madsen and the All In One representative Ryan Meeks. This resulted in All In One canceling all of their existing work with Madsen.\n2\\. Unpaid invoices and new charges: After the confrontation, All In One tried to collect on some unpaid invoices, but Madsen claimed these had already been paid. All In One then added new miscellaneous charges to the invoices, which Madsen disputed.\n3\\. Attempt to solicit client behind Madsen's back: While Madsen was trying to find alternative flooring sources for a job, a representative from All In One Flooring contacted the client directly to try to get the job, offering a lower price. The client refused and informed Madsen.\n4\\. Small claims court case and judgment: Madsen was sued by All In One in small claims court over a $4,000 carpet installation job. Madsen lost this case, with the judge ruling in favor of All In One and ordering Madsen to pay $7,261.78.\n5\\. Potential appeal and legal strategy: Hepworth discussed potential strategies for appealing the small claims court judgment, including arguing that All In One failed to mitigate their damages by not reselling the unused flooring materials. Hepworth also suggested exploring options like mediation or settlement to resolve the larger $13,000 dispute.\n6\\. Concerns about the opposing counsel: Hepworth expressed concerns about the opposing counsel, Cole Parkinson, describing him as an \"alpha male\" type who was more interested in posturing than negotiating in good faith.\nOverall, the consultation focused on developing a comprehensive legal strategy to defend Madsen Remodeling against the claims from All In One Flooring, while also exploring opportunities for settlement or mediation to resolve the dispute efficiently.\n\nThe consultation was between Attorney Michael Hepworth and clients Jon and Mike Madsen, who are joint owners of Madsen Remodeling.

Concerns about the opposing counsel: Hepworth expressed concerns about the opposing counsel, Cole Parkinson, describing him as an \"alpha male\" type who was more interested in posturing than negotiating in good faith.\n7\\. Retainer agreement and legal fees: Hepworth mentioned that his firm would assign him and another lawyer, along with paralegals, to work on the case. He said he would send over a retainer agreement, and that the retainer fee would be around $6,000. Hepworth explained that this would be the maximum out-of-pocket cost, as any unused portion of the retainer would be refunded.\nOverall, the consultation focused on developing a comprehensive legal strategy to defend Madsen Remodeling against the claims from All In One Flooring, while also exploring opportunities for settlement or mediation to resolve the dispute efficiently.\n",

We are well-equipped to handle your legal matter and are confident that we can provide the guidance and support you need. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have; we're here to help you navigate through this with ease and expertise.\n\nBest regards,\nZarah at Hepworth Legal\n\nUser @ 11/1/2024, 6:02:33 AM\nZarah, I just received a message from a friend at Incline at Anthem.\nIt has five stories and a 55+community. We had over 100 units, with residents and electric wheelchairs abound.  The main elevator is still out, and parts are again on order.\n\nBot @ 11/1/2024, 6:02:57 AM\nHello Linda, my name is Zarah, and I am an AI legal assistant for Hepworth Legal. I understand how distressing it must be to face eviction and issues with accessibility in your community, especially after fulfilling your rent obligations. In Utah, landlords must provide reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities, and this includes maintaining functional essential services like elevators. Can you tell me if there have been any attempts to communicate with the management about the elevator situation?\n\nUser @ 11/1/2024, 6:09:44 AM\nConstantly we are told 'sorry about that' the parts are on order. They send out memos and we are constantly telling them we are not happy. They have the elevator company out front of the building for hours. I'm sorry I don't know the name of the company. They change alot.\n\nBot @ 11/1/2024, 6:09:58 AM\nI'm sorry to hear about the ongoing issues, Linda. It's important for landlords to maintain essential services. I recommend scheduling a consultation with Hepworth Legal to explore your options regarding the eviction and accessibility concerns. Would you be interested in setting up a consultation to discuss this further?\n\nUser @ 11/1/2024, 6:12:53 AM\nHe is to call me today at 1:30.\nCould you send me his e-mail address and I could send some of the memos from Incline related?\n\nBot @ 11/1/2024, 6:13:22 AM\nI recommend scheduling a 30-minute consultation for $250 or a 60-minute consultation for $350 with one of our expert attorneys. During the consultation, they will provide you with next steps and, if possible, help resolve your legal issue. I can schedule the consultation for you right now. Would you like me to proceed with scheduling the 30-minute consult?\n\nUser @ 11/1/2024, 6:18:15 AM\nI have already scheduled the one hour consultation and paid the $350. necessary fee.\n\nBot @ 11/1/2024, 6:18:45 AM\nThank you for confirming the consultation, Linda. Please feel free to email any relevant documents or memos to info@hepworthlegal.com. A paralegal will receive them and ensure they are ready for your consultation.

My desk got busted up. I should have got insurance on the truck, but I paid $179.00 hr. to have it packed.\nYou said you would talk to Incline.\nI'm a 100% disabled veteran, and I am 76 yrs old. I should not be treated this way. My friend said it would be a good 'human interest story' for Channel 2 News in Salt Lake.\nI would appreciate a reply or do I need to pay you more too.\nBot @ 11/13/2024, 7:15:03 AM\nHello Linda, Ryan has yet to hear from the complex. We will let you know if we hear anything from them, so I would highly suggest reaching out to Timpanogos Legal Center &/or Utah Legal Services as they do not require retainer fees to aide in assisting. \n"

Some key details:\n\n\\- Dale was recently served divorce papers by his wife of 31 years, Melissa. They need to respond within 14 days.\n\n\\- Melissa is proposing to stay in the marital home and pay Dale half the equity within 6 months.\n\n\\- Dale and Melissa may have retirement benefits to split according to the Woodward formula.\n\n\\- Michael advised preparing a counter petition opposing Melissa's requests and presenting Dale's arguments.\n\n\\- They discussed financial disclosure challenges due to Melissa's lack of transparency with taxes.\n\n\\- Michael estimated $4,000-$10,000 in legal fees but said the case seemed straightforward with no children or complex assets.\n\n\\- Dale is struggling financially so Michael offered a lien on Dale's property or line of credit for legal fees.\n\n\\- They discussed options for dividing assets like the marital home, retirement funds, and pending inheritance.\n\n\\- Michael said he would prepare the necessary legal documents and assign staff to Dale's case.\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Started driving for Uber in 2020. Blocked in 2022. Over two years. No problems. Two riders and a dog. One rider going to work. The other, don't know where she is going. Didn't request Uber Pet. One woman tried to assault Majok. He rolled up the window and cancelled the ride. She said, \"We will have Uber disconnect your ass.\" \n\nJennie helped Majok call Uber and transfer from department to department to department until Majok received an invitation through his Uber driver app to submit an appeal. Jennie helped Majok submit that appeal, which was instantly denied. So Jennie helped Majok call Uber back to complain that his appeal needed to be read and reviewed by a human being with a brain. The call was transfered around again until we finally got to someone who seemed to understand, and Majok got another invitation through his Uber driver app to submit his appeal. Jennie helped Majok do that, and this time there was no automated response. So we think it might go to a human. Majok is going to monitor the app for a decision and let us know if he needs any further help. \n\nIf Jennie managed to get this straightened out, then Majok is going to send in all his friends whose accounts have been deactivated because this happens all the damn time.\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Based on the dialogue analysis, I can identify:\n- Speaker 4 is Attorney Sarah Spitzer\n- Speaker 3 is Client Eitiel Or\n- Speaker 2 appears to be Karen (a facilitator/intermediary)\n\n# Consultation Summary\n\n## Overview\nThe consultation focused on responding to a subpoena from the Utah Division of Consumer Protection requesting business records from Eitiel Or. The subpoena requires production of various business documents, including customer records, invoices, work orders, and bank statements from December 2024 to present. The client recently experienced a car break-in where many business records were stolen, limiting available documentation to the past two months.\n\n## Action Items\n1. Attorney to:\n- Draft and send retainer agreement\n- Request two-week extension for subpoena compliance\n- Review and redact sensitive information from bank statements\n- Assist with document production\n\n1. Client to:\n- Sign retainer agreement\n- Pay $3,000 retainer fee\n- Gather available business documents\n- Provide bank statements\n- Compile available customer records from past two months\n\n## Insights\n- Client has limited records due to recent theft of business documents\n- Attempting to quash the subpoena likely wouldn't succeed given it's from Utah Division of Consumer Protection\n- Compliance is recommended as the best course of action\n- Personal/family-related transactions can be redacted from bank statements\n- Client expressed concern about personal funds transfer ($50,000 inheritance)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Attorney to send retainer agreement via email\n2. Client to digitally sign agreement\n3. Client to submit retainer payment\n4. Attorney to request extension from opposing party\n5. Begin document collection and review process\n\n## Questions Discussed\n- Whether court appearance would be required (generally no if complying)\n- Possibility of fines (not expected if complying)\n- Scope of required bank statement disclosure\n- Handling of personal transactions in business accounts\n- Consequences of non-compliance with subpoena\n\n## Timeline\n- Original subpoena deadline: 05/15/2025\n- Seeking two-week extension from current date\n- Document collection period: December 2024 to present\n- Available records: Previous two months only\n\n## Conclusion\nThe consultation established a clear path forward for subpoena compliance. Attorney will assist with document production and proper redaction of sensitive information. The $3,000 retainer agreement will be sent immediately, and work will begin upon receipt of signed agreement and payment. The focus is on compliant response while protecting client's personal information not relevant to the investigation.\n",

        "Consult Transcript (Claude)": "Based on the dialogue analysis, I can identify:\n- Speaker 4 is Attorney Sarah Spitzer\n- Speaker 3 is Client Eitiel Or\n- Speaker 2 appears to be Karen (a facilitator/intermediary)\n\n# Consultation Summary\n\n## Overview\nThe consultation focused on responding to a subpoena from the Utah Division of Consumer Protection requesting business records from Eitiel Or. The subpoena requires production of various business documents, including customer records, invoices, work orders, and bank statements from December 2024 to present. The client recently experienced a car break-in where many business records were stolen, limiting available documentation to the past two months.\n\n## Action Items\n1. Attorney to:\n- Draft and send retainer agreement\n- Request two-week extension for subpoena compliance\n- Review and redact sensitive information from bank statements\n- Assist with document production\n\n1. Client to:\n- Sign retainer agreement\n- Pay $3,000 retainer fee\n- Gather available business documents\n- Provide bank statements\n- Compile available customer records from past two months\n\n## Insights\n- Client has limited records due to recent theft of business documents\n- Attempting to quash the subpoena likely wouldn't succeed given it's from Utah Division of Consumer Protection\n- Compliance is recommended as the best course of action\n- Personal/family-related transactions can be redacted from bank statements\n- Client expressed concern about personal funds transfer ($50,000 inheritance)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Attorney to send retainer agreement via email\n2. Client to digitally sign agreement\n3. Client to submit retainer payment\n4. Attorney to request extension from opposing party\n5. Begin document collection and review process\n\n## Questions Discussed\n- Whether court appearance would be required (generally no if complying)\n- Possibility of fines (not expected if complying)\n- Scope of required bank statement disclosure\n- Handling of personal transactions in business accounts\n- Consequences of non-compliance with subpoena\n\n## Timeline\n- Original subpoena deadline: 05/15/2025\n- Seeking two-week extension from current date\n- Document collection period: December 2024 to present\n- Available records: Previous two months only\n\n## Conclusion\nThe consultation established a clear path forward for subpoena compliance. Attorney will assist with document production and proper redaction of sensitive information. The $3,000 retainer agreement will be sent immediately, and work will begin upon receipt of signed agreement and payment. The focus is on compliant response while protecting client's personal information not relevant to the investigation.\n",

Attorney Spitzer effectively explained the subpoena process and recommended compliance rather than opposition. The consultation had a structured flow, beginning with situation assessment, moving to legal strategy, and concluding with retention. A critical moment occurred when the client expressed concern about personal funds transferred to his business account, which the attorney addressed by explaining redaction options.\n\n### Attorney Performance Analysis\n**Expertise Demonstration (85%)**: Spitzer demonstrated solid knowledge of subpoena procedures: \"We're unlikely if we tried to file a motion to quash the subpoena... to succeed just given who it is.\" She clearly explained compliance requirements and potential consequences: \"They can get a court order to compel you to comply.\"\n\n**Sales Technique (80%)**: The attorney presented a clear value proposition by explaining how she would handle the extension request and document production. When the client expressed concern about bank transfers, she effectively addressed this objection: \"We can basically do what's called redacting, and we would redact those and basically black them out from the document.\"\n\n**Professional Presence (85%)**: Spitzer maintained a confident, reassuring tone throughout, particularly when explaining legal concepts in accessible terms. She demonstrated good time management by keeping the consultation focused on necessary information.\n\n**Client Engagement (82%)**: The attorney confirmed understanding at key points and addressed the client's concerns about court appearances and potential fines. However, she could have built stronger initial rapport before diving into legal details.\n\n### Improvement Recommendations\n1. Establish stronger rapport at consultation start before addressing legal issues\n2. Probe earlier for potential client concerns about document production\n3. Provide more specific examples of what the redaction process looks like\n4. Offer clearer timeline for the entire process beyond the two-week extension\n5. Follow up with a summary email outlining next steps and document requirements\n\nThe attorney successfully retained the client by clearly explaining the legal situation, addressing concerns about financial privacy, and presenting a straightforward solution with a defined fee structure. The presence of Karen as a trusted referrer also facilitated the retention process."

And then I know it's I can you walk me through what's what's kinda going on with you? I imagine it's the same as, Karen had mentioned. There's a couple people coming to see us, or as it relates to a subpoena. Can you walk me through what's going on there?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Like, what exactly do you need to know?\n\nSpeaker 4: Just what you've received, maybe you know, what's what's kinda going on? What are they asking for? All that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 3: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's send that to her right now, I feel. From your email, let's send that to her so she can look at it with you.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So are you okay with that, Sarah?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay.

That's right. .Com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. That's cool. Okay. Let's see if she gets it here. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 3: Just sent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Let me just take a look here and see it come through.\n\nSpeaker 2: So at at ATL is on the same boat as as as Ellie. They don't know that they've done anything wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they're not really sure why they're asking for this. Same scenario. They have happy customers. If ever they've had a customer, SEL especially, he can send their money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Let me just wait for this to come through.\n\nSpeaker 4: And so walk me through. As I'm waiting for it to come through, it's they're just wanting business information and different things like that generally.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Yeah. Like, they they want, like, my and my customers for, like, the past six months, which I told him that I don't have it because my car gets, like, broken, and I have, like, a police And they stole my, my iPad for my work and all my, you know, my receipts, like, my the folder folder receipt for all my customers. So I don't have it in my new system. And that's what I explained in that I have, like, customer for, like, just last month or two months.\n\nOkay. You know? Because someone broke into my car.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Got it. Oh, and it looks like this one was for 05/15/2025. Okay. Okay.\n\nAnd so let me just take a look here. Events of,\n\nSpeaker 0: like, below\n\nSpeaker 1: documents about jobs originating from customer leader service. Locksmith. K. Invoices, work orders. Okay.\n\nAnd do\n\nSpeaker 4: you have backup copies anywhere of, you know, any of this the documents, invoices, work orders, estimates, all that sort of stuff? I mean, do you have copies of that somewhere, or was it all taken when the car was broken into?\n\nSpeaker 3: Everything was in the car broken, and I don't have the access anymore. But I do have, like, for my two months. Let let the past two months, I'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Like,\n\nSpeaker 3: you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: this. Okay. We got them on digital. We're I mean, I'm working as hard as I can through every one of these kits\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: To try to help them with having what they're supposed to get, you know?\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So with that, we can what we need to do is produce everything that at least we can produce. So the way it it kinda works is given who's making the request and I'll run you through it. It's the Utah division of consumer protection. We're unlikely if we tried to file, for example, like, a motion to quash the subpoena or different things like that, we would be unlikely to succeed just given who it is.\n\nSo the better course of avenue would be as long as you don't have anything to worry about going ahead and producing everything that they're asking for. And then if they don't find anything that they're looking for, they'll just can they'll move on, essentially. So what will happen is is, you know, if there's nothing in there that's problematic or anything like that that we're producing, they'll see the information and then they just will move will move forward and move on. And so I would say we need to go ahead and produce everything that we can. Given that you were supposed to produce it by 05/15/2025, I can still reach out to the opposing party, and see if we can request an extension would be my what I would recommend.\n\nAnd so I can reach out to them and just see if they would give us maybe about a two week extension to get everything together, let them know that you've retained counsel. And then we can look at going through the documents and just helping you get get everything together essentially to produce it, unless you feel comfortable doing that on your own. It's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. He wants your help.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Perfect. Okay. And so with that, what we would do is we usually do it, in this case, we'll do it as a $3,000 retainer. It's the same as we're doing, with your other friend as well, and we would do it as a $3,000 retainer.\n\nWe will have you give us all the documentation that you have, and then, basically, we'll just assist you with the complying subpoena and producing everything that you can, to the Utah division of consumer protection, essentially.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that means we need to copy and email all those invoices. Yes. Right?\n\nSpeaker 4: Mhmm. So yeah. So it's everything that they requested, everything that you have as far as invoices, work orders, estimates, call records, you know, any sort of, payments made by you, for a lead or different things like that. With bank statements, you know, we can redact stuff that's not relevant, but, stuff related to leads or different things like that, we'll need to produce as well.\n\nSpeaker 3: But from when? Like, from what time?\n\nSpeaker 4: So I'm gonna today? Request an extension, but probably from two weeks from, I would say, today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So in two weeks, we need to get the papers together, and we're gonna get them just you know? So do you want six months of bank statements, Sarah?\n\nSpeaker 4: We want as much that will comply with the subpoena. So they're requesting, everything from December 2024 until the current date. So whatever he has, we will gonna wanna go ahead and produce that, and then we can look through it and and make sure everything's good to produce.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright. We'll get working on that, and then the next step would be for him to pay you the retainer. Right?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. So what I will do is I can draft up the retainer agreement, and then I will get it over to you. And then just look it over and make sure everything looks good. If it does, you can go ahead and sign it, and then we'll have you pay the 3,000, and then we will go ahead and, we can assist you in getting the documents together and getting everything over to, the opposing party.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. Okay. Do you know what\n\nSpeaker 0: that means?\n\nSpeaker 3: I have a question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: So what what's, like, what's gonna happen, like, if we're gonna answer to the subpoena and everything and I'm still gonna need to go to the court, or I don't need to go to the court?\n\nSpeaker 4: So if since we're not opposing it, since you would be complying with it, no. You generally aren't gonna have to go to court. So what happens is is you'll just comply with the subpoena, and you would produce everything that they're requesting. You know, if there's something like if for example they found something in there that was problematic or something like that, then there might be a potential for having to go to court or something like that, but if there's nothing problematic in the documents, you likely won't have to go to court. You likely just comply with everything, and then that's that's pretty much it.\n\nBecause the lawsuit is not related to you. Correct? The lawsuit is related to a third party?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Okay. Yeah. So you\n\nSpeaker 3: I mean, I I I'm not I'm gonna get a fine in the end of the day, like, after I paid the 3,000 or something like this, I'm gonna get a fine from Bradley? Or\n\nSpeaker 4: You shouldn't get a fine or anything like that. So the way the subpoena works is, a subpoena is basically a request of for information from a third party. When you in enter into a lawsuit, what happens is is that if I need information, let's say, and I need that information from a bank or another person who has it, and they're not a party to the lawsuit, I have to file a subpoena, and that's the request for information. That's what you've obtained. That's what's been given to you here.\n\nAnd what that means is you're not a party to the lawsuit, but you may have information that's relevant to the lawsuit they're in. And so that's why they're requesting records or things like that because the third party lawsuit that's going on, may pertain to certain information you have or things like that, and that's why they're requesting that. So the two options that we have is we can either comply with it and we can give them everything that they're asking for as long as there's nothing that's going to be incriminating or problematic for you, or we can try to quash it. But in order to quash the subpoena, we have to have a very good reason for doing so. And given that it's the Utah division of consumer protection, they generally have broad powers to take a look at certain documents and information, so the likelihood of succeeding on trying to quash it would be very slim.\n\nSo the best opera the best kind of course of action would be to go ahead and comply with it, so that way you're not spending more money trying to quash a subpoena that ultimately gets granted, and then you have to provide the information anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. We just have to give them six months of your bank statements. You need to come in, and we'll print, you know, the law.\n\nSpeaker 3: Just just just just just just just\n\nSpeaker 0: just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just\n\nSpeaker 3: just just just statement?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. And then whatever invoices and stuff you have now, so they they kinda wanna get\n\nSpeaker 1: an idea of how you're doing business, which you're doing legal business. You don't have to fear this. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. So as long as there's\n\nSpeaker 3: of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: I mean yeah. Like, for example, if I will not play to the subpoena\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 3: I can be in trouble?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. They can get a court order to compel you to comply. So you can be forced by a court to comply with the subpoena. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You ready to go ahead with it, Danette? Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. We we will do it.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Great.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Perfect. So I'll go ahead and I'll get you what's called a retainer agreement, and that's just an agreement between us, that we'll go ahead and represent you in this particular thing, and it's just to help you comply with the subpoena and produce all the documents. And the first thing I will go ahead and do is I will request an extension of time and just let him know that you just retained us and that we're gonna try to get everything over to him in the next two weeks as long as they're amenable to that deadline. And then I'll just keep you posted.\n\nOnce you pay the retainer, I can go ahead and send that email, and then I will let you know, kinda next steps from there. We'll have you get your documents together to produce. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: Any other questions for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So it's gonna come on email at Yale, and then you need to sign it and pay on the from the link. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 3: It's what? Okay. It's\n\nSpeaker 2: gonna come on email, and then you need to sign it and then send it back to her. Does it give an option for digital signature, Sarah?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes. It does.\n\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Could could it why do you need my statement, bud?\n\nSpeaker 4: So that's because it's part of the subpoena. They're requesting, all documents that evidence any payments made by you to any locksmith for a customer lead or service call referral that you received. So if there's any payments that you have made, for something like that, then that's why we would need to produce bank statements. If there's nothing like that, then we don't have to produce them. But if you have made payments for something like that, then we need to produce those payments.\n\nThat's why it would it would be the bank statements.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. They I mean, they gotta they're gonna take a look at how you do business, so that's what it is. I don't I don't believe there's anything to be worried about at Yale. And you have this attorney here that's gonna help you.\n\nIf she sees anything that she might be worried that they see, then she's gonna be there to counsel you. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 3: Mhmm. You there, NPL? Yeah. No. This Okay.\n\nBecause, you know, I I did, like, a a transfer, you know, for my banking as well to here. It's, like, 50, 50,000. Mhmm. And but I don't want, like, to get trouble about it.\n\nSpeaker 4: Well, just It's\n\nSpeaker 3: like it's it's yeah. One sec. It's like it's illegal like, it's illegal money. Like, it's money for that I received from my mother Mhmm. That she passed away.\n\nMhmm. And, you know, I transferred to her, but this I don't want to get over about it.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. So certain payments like that that aren't relevant to your business, that's a family matter. We can basically do what we it's called redacting, and we would redact those and basically black them out from the document so they can't see them. And then we would basically provide what's called a privilege log that says, this is what this is, and we describe it, but we don't need to tell them any specifics. We can say these are family payments or like that without providing a lot of detail, and there's no reason why they can make a request to be able to get to those because it's separate from your business.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But it's, like, it's going to to my business account. Yeah. But it's, like, it's going to to my business account.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. But it's, like, like, it's going to to my business account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Okay. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 4: Well, we can take a look at it and see, but if there's things that aren't relevant to what they're asking about because they're very specifically asking about, like, referrals, and things like that. So if it's not if it doesn't qualify as anything like that, we should still be able to redact it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Redact means they hide it as hell. So the paper goes to him and everything's blacked out but, like, your customer payment, that's it?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: They don't get all your business. They only get the business as it relates to the customers that you served. Mhmm. Which you make your customers happy or you truth. You don't have to worry.\n\nSpeaker 3: No. It's okay. Okay? Okay. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It sounds like we're on the right page then,\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: Alright. Do you have any other questions for me?\n\nSpeaker 3: No. Not really. I will talk with Karen. I will meet Karen tomorrow, and Okay. I will see okay.\n\nI will talk with Karen about everything.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. That sounds good. And if you guys have any questions, feel free to reach out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you so much. I'm a look forward to your email. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 4: Alright. That sounds good. You guys have a good day. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Tara. Mhmm. You too. Okay. You too.\n\nBye.\n",

How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 0: Good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey. I'm doing well. I'm calling because we had a a consultation scheduled for this time today, and it looks like in the notes, it was for both you and your wife. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And she's here right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's that would be my next question. Okay. So before we get into it, I just want to get through some preliminary stuff. First things first, we record all these conversations.\n\nPart of that is quality control. Part of it is I have some software that helps take notes. With that being said, everything we talk about is covered under attorney client privilege. That includes the recording and it includes the notes. Additionally, because the two of you are married, you have spousal privilege, so everything's confidential between the two of you as well.\n\nDoes that all make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good. Let me make sure okay. I did. Okay.\n\nSo I I got the notes. I saw a whole bunch of screenshots that I looked through a little bit. Mhmm. But why don't we start from the top and have you guys just tell me what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright. You ready to hear it? I got a whole story.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's hear it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I was hired to run the golf course here in Beaver back in 2021. Mhmm. When I got hired, I got hired by the city, and I re I took the position that the previous employer was a mother whose daughter, niece, and daughter or it'd be like a nephew's wife put in for it. It was a whole town with me.\n\nAnd when none of them got the job, they were very, very, very mad. And they have made my life a living hell for the past five years. This is my fifth summer running the course, and I think I do it pretty well. But because of all of this hatred towards me, and there's been a lot of allegations and a lot of rumors made up by this family that have really incriminated me and has made it really hard. So she went over to me for about a month before I went to the city council, and I asked them if they would dismiss her because she was making my life so hard.\n\nTons of workplace trauma and abuse. And finally, it's okay. Let's dismiss her, and then Shanna can just figure\n\nSpeaker 0: it out, and I just started running the course.\n\nSpeaker 2: That being said and then we go into, like, maybe that was the summer of twenty one, and that went fine. We went into the summer of twenty twenty two. And there was an employee that worked out on the ground that was getting divorced from one of the the it would be that lady's niece that put in for the job. Her name was Christa, and she didn't get the job. So she was already mad at me.\n\nAnd her husband worked at the course, Moline Lawn, and they were going through a divorce, and he just worked for me. There was nothing else going on. But because they were getting divorced, her family was running around town saying that I was sleeping with him, saying that all this inappropriate conduct was going on between me and my employee, which it wasn't, and they pretty much blamed me for the reason they got divorced. I mean, all of that wasn't true, and the guy ended up quitting the golf course and left and went somewhere else, and everything kinda settled with that because that was three years ago until this last week. So when we can speed back up to 2023 is when I hired a couple of sisters to come and work at the golf course for me.\n\nAnd one of them, her name is Chacey, and she has always been a very, very bad employee. Wouldn't show up on time, would cause fights with customers, just a lot of drama. She's so much drama. She also was my assistant coach because I coach high school golf, or I used to coach high school golf. And, so she coaches me that first season, and then she was working for me the past two years.\n\nWe came to a decision on a city level. I mean, it was it was this in the spring. She I found two other assistant coaches to help me, and she decided she didn't wanna coach. Mhmm. She didn't come to the first day of practice, and she felt like she didn't belong.\n\nAnd so she said she wasn't gonna coach, and we thought I thought we were on good terms with it until you read these awful Facebook posts from her and her mother about the whole situation. So she quit coaching on her own. A couple weeks after that, there was a lot more problems at the golf course and a lot of drama and fights and other employee things. She was really undermining to my assistant manager, and the city the city manager and the HR decided that we just need to let her go. So we let her go.\n\nMhmm. And that's when this got really bad out of control. Her mom's been posting on Facebook very mean incriminating things. They don't say my name, but they say golf course manager, and we live in such a small town. Like, everybody knows they're talking about me.\n\nAnd then she got on Facebook and was saying more things. And the lady that I, replaced, her name is Melanie Myers, and she had also blessed a big incriminating post on Facebook as well. And she has just been doing whatever she can to make anything up to try to get in trouble, try to get me fired. They went to a city council meeting. Her, it was Tracy, her was it her mom?\n\nAnother member of the community I don't even really know. And then this girl, Krista, that was mad about her husband and her divorce and how she didn't work at the golf course anymore. And they went in there with tons of crazy allegations of why I'm so unfit, why I'm awful, you know, like like, a lot of, like, petty, you know, opinion things.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I\n\nSpeaker 2: think there could be some very incriminating things in there too, but I didn't I wasn't able to hear it on the minute to very to, like, see if there's actual concrete proof of the incriminating things that they were saying. But then, Shacey has been emailing city council members the incriminating things that she's accusing me of that she knows are not true, but she's just trying to get me fired. Mhmm. Well, this last week, I I mean, the cops did open an investigation on this. So the cops took a new investigation, and they're investigating me giving alcohol to minors along with an incident that we had at the golf course three years ago.\n\nThree years ago, we had, we had a night golf tournament, and my employees wanted to make jello shots and give them away. Mhmm. And they did that, and I should have never granted permission for it. But I really had no training jumping into my job, and I really didn't know what I was doing. And that was only the second summer I ran the course.\n\nAnd I said, okay. Like, yeah. Like, if you guys wanna take care of it, like, you know, you can't be clocked in or anything. You're not on city time. Like, just make sure you ID kids.\n\nMake sure that nobody underage is drinking. Like, make sure that is not a thing. We did not have a liquor license, so that is totally on me, totally my fault. After that happened, the city pulled me in, and they reprimanded me for it. And they said, Shanna, don't ever let this happen again.\n\nAnd I learned my lesson and we have never let this happen again. That being said, they are investigating things from that night as well as calling random children in the community to ask them if I've ever distributed out the whole to them. And this has been going on for probably the last couple of months, and, I mean, I've never I've never ever ever given anything like that to a kid. And, and I coach, and I coach golf for the past four years. In the last three years, we won state championships.\n\nSo I feel like I'm a pretty good coach, and I really put my whole heart and soul to it. And the kids are safe with me, and the parents know the kids are safe with me. This last week, the high school pulled me in, and they terminated me because of the allegations and rumors and, speculation involved with these rumors from this ex employee of mine.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's kind of where we are up to date. That's kind of a lot of it. But during the time, there was also a couple of employees that worked for the city. Their names are Paula Feld and David Martin. And it was David's daughter-in-law that put in for this job and didn't get it.\n\nSo he's been mad about that for the past five years, and then Paula's daughter would be Krista. And she, and they've been awful to me to work in the city. The whole city is such a toxic workplace environment because they're awful to everybody. This last winter, they were making us rumors and spreading around town that I was sleeping with my boss. They got my boss reprimanded.\n\nWe were going through this whole city process to try to deal with all the rumors and all the the he said she said stuff that was going on because of how incriminating it was and how disrespectful it was. And we're still trying to process through all that. But I just have to the whole family that's just so mad that I have my job, that they are getting me five for things I didn't do and blame for things I didn't do. And and the accusation has became severely that I have lost my employment with, the school district that I will probably never get to work for again, which is a shame because I really had all these goals to just win state championships after state championship and just coach these kids. And that's kinda currently where we are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mentioned the investigation, Jason.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there was an investigation with me and my boss because that's what the city council did. They investigated me and my boss, and that investigation turned up false because nothing was going on. So that did come up\n\nSpeaker 1: false. Okay. So so the stuff that you were fired from the school district for Yeah. Those rumors, it sounds like what you're talking about is stuff being said that isn't in these Facebook posts. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So where was that stuff said?\n\nSpeaker 2: The rumors or the Facebook post?\n\nSpeaker 1: The the stuff that got you fired.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I was in my meeting, I asked them not to tell me why I got fired because I genuinely did not want to know. We would probably have to request something from the school to see if they would, like, fill out, like, a termination paper or what the cause of termination was. I know employers typically don't do that, though, but they didn't discuss it with me either why I got let go. I can only imagine it's because of the rumors of the drinking, the high school kids drinking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So who who actually fired you?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was principal Feld. It was principal Feld and the athletic director that fired me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And they didn't give you reason. They just said they really need help?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: They offered to give me a reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: They offered to give me a reason. I told them I didn't have the mental capacity to handle it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Talk to me about the Facebook posts. These were you said these were recent?\n\nSpeaker 2: They were recent. They were probably a month ago, two months ago, and it was for my employer and my employer's mom that posted about it on\n\nSpeaker 1: Facebook. Your your employer?\n\nSpeaker 2: My employee. My employee that we had just fired Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: And\n\nSpeaker 2: then that employee's mother.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I thought was going on, but it sounded like you said employer there, so I wanted to be\n\nSpeaker 0: sure I was clear.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. My my ex employee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay. Okay. So we're gonna take a little we're gonna take a minute here where I'm gonna give you kind of a general spiel about defamation cases, and then we'll apply that stuff to your situation. Okay?\n\nSo\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: In general, defamation cases have four elements, with kind of a fifth, like, subelement that you have to prove or that you have to show that, to establish a case for defamation. The I'll go through those four big categories, and then we'll kinda talk about the subelement. I'm not sure it applies here, but we'll we'll go over it anyway. So first, the things that are being said have to be false. Right?\n\nSecond, they have to be published. Third, they have to be said with some degree of intent, whether that's negligent or malicious. And then four, there have to be damages. The the kind of fifth, like, little subcategory thing is that the thing the false thing that was said can't be in a privileged communication. Right?\n\nSo so, generally, that means it can't be said in, like, a in, like, a, like, a court proceeding or an agency investigation or to clergy or, you know, several things that are are are considered privileged.\n\nSpeaker 0: What about a city council meeting?\n\nSpeaker 1: A city council meeting is that one is a little bit less clear. It depends on the context around the meeting. If it's a generally speaking, if it's a public forum, like, if it's a public meeting, then it's not privileged. If it's like a\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And this this one was a public meeting. So It\n\nSpeaker 1: and I should I I will say that if it's a public meeting, then it might not be privileged. Right? I'm I'm not gonna say for sure that it isn't. I think that there would be an argument to be had about it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But generally because generally speaking, when you're talking to public bodies, you know, governmental agencies, governmental bodies, generally, those are privileged. But when it becomes a when it's a public hearing and it's said in front of a public hearing, that's that's a little bit it's a little bit of a gray area. So that's kind of the general, layout of of defamation. So now that you have that context, a couple of things. I'm gonna start with the Facebook post.\n\nI read them, and I am not sure that there is enough here, on the Facebook post. We'll come back to the other stuff because I think that the other stuff is a little bit meatier, but the Facebook posts, they're not they're not great. Right? But they like, the one I'm looking at right now is the first one. No.\n\nI'm sorry. This is the one that Josie Shotwell posted, and it is I I would struggle to imagine that anything in here would be something that we could establish caused actual damages on its own. Right? It's it's, you know, mean. It's a little nasty.\n\nIt's it certainly, you know, seems uncalled for, but I don't know that there's anything in it that is like, when I look at this kind of thing, I look for allegations of criminal behavior and stuff like that. I don't see anything that rises to that level. And the stuff that she does say, if it even if it were true, it's mostly it's stuff that isn't particularly egregious. Right? It sounds like an upset parent ranting.\n\nRight? So I don't know that that the Facebook posts on their own are worth much, and so I wanna kinda set them aside for a minute. The the big question that I have about about your case in as a whole is damages. Right? And until you said that you had lost your job with the school district, I wasn't super convinced that we were gonna be able to establish any damages.\n\nLosing your job over something like this is very easy to establish as concrete damages. Right? That is something that we could that we could say, okay. We've met the we've met the elements here because we have damages. But what I'm concerned about is connecting that loss of the job to any of this stuff.\n\nRight? And we would have to get the principal, the athletic director, you know, whoever made the decision to let you go, we would have to get them to admit that it was because of these rumors going around that were not true. And even then, right, the we we would have to identify the sources of those rumors, and we would have to do it in a way that we could convince a judge or a jury that it was that person. Right? So talk to me a little bit about because you've you've listed several people, and you've said that you, you know, you know it's them saying the stuff.\n\nTalk to me\n\nSpeaker 0: a little bit about that. 16. Oh my\n\nSpeaker 2: god. This call is being recorded.\n\nSpeaker 0: Hello? Hey. I think I I think I\n\nSpeaker 1: got cut off, and I've been sitting here talking to a deadline for the last four minutes or so.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry. I've been trying to call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No worries. It happens. Okay. So tell tell me me what the last thing you heard was and I'll try to pick off where we left off.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're talking about the four scenes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, wow. And one of the we were talking about if the city public city meeting was considered\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Protected\n\nSpeaker 1: or Okay. So so the the city council meeting, whether or not that's considered privileged is a little bit of an open question. It, you know, it can there are arguments to be made for both. So, you know, maybe. Let's let's set that aside though, and let's talk about your case specifically.\n\nSo I wanna start I'm gonna start with the Facebook posts because, frankly, I don't think that the Facebook posts are by themselves. I don't think there's enough there. Right? They are Okay. They're they're rude.\n\nThey are, you know, in some places pretty nasty, and they certainly seem, you know, a little uncalled for, but they're not they don't they don't veer into what seems obvious to me as defamatory stuff. Right? It seems like there's only a couple places where they say anything that couldn't be pretty easily argued was just an opinion. There are some places where they are pretty there are some places in the post where they are pretty direct and and concrete, but it's not a lot. And beyond any of that, I don't wanna minimize what's being said in here.\n\nIt's not it's not great. But beyond any of that, it would be very difficult to establish damages from these Facebook posts. However and I and I'll and I'll tell you the truth. While I was reviewing this before we spoke, I kinda thought that that was going to be the end of the conversation was I just not I'm not sure there's enough in these Facebook posts. I don't think there's enough there.\n\nI don't think you have anything. But when you started talking about losing your job at the school district, my ears perked up a little bit. Now Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: They're going to there would there will be I don't want to\n\nSpeaker 1: get your hopes up too much here. I don't want you to think that I'm saying that there's definitely something there because I think there are challenges there. But Mhmm. With losing your job with the school district, that means that we have concrete damages. Right?\n\nSo that's one of the the four big elements I talked about. We have concrete damages. Whenever I do one of these consults, I take I take take your word for it. Right? Because I have no reason not to.\n\nSo so when it comes to the truth or falsity of the statements, I, you know, I'm checking off that box saying they're false statements. We know that that we we'll we'll set aside publication because I wanna talk about that in in a different context in a second. So we'll set aside the publication element. The intent, the the things that you're saying, the rumors that are going around, I mean, some of those are are are are criminal allegations. Right?\n\nAnd so that is\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you are if you were saying those kinds of things and you know them to be untrue or you should know that they're untrue, then then intent is an easy thing to, is an easy thing to infer. So we're we're we've got, you know, we've got three of the four elements. Now the, the publication part, I wanna talk I I said I wanted to talk about that in a different context because we don't know exactly why you were fired. Right? We don't we don't have the actual reasoning.\n\nAnd so we would have to get over a couple of hurdles to establish defamation here. First, we have to get somebody from the school district who is involved in that decision to admit that the decision was based on these rumors or allegations. Right? That's part one.\n\nSpeaker 0: K.\n\nSpeaker 1: Part two is we have to be able to prove to a pretty convincing degree where those rumors came from. Right? Now we you guys can say to me all you want that you know that these people have this grudge against you because you got this job and they didn't or their family member didn't or their friend didn't or whatever. And listen, I I should I should tell you, I'm not from Utah, but I am from the rural South, and I know about small town dynamics and all that kind of stuff. I I get it.\n\nYeah. You know, when everybody knows everybody and something like this happens, it can spin out of control pretty quick. Yep. I get that. But you can't go to a judge in a court and say, you're honored.\n\nThis is a small town. You can you can connect the dots here. Right? You have to be able to show Yes. I understand.\n\nExactly like, you have to have pretty convincing evidence to show where these rumors started. And so let's so talk to me a little bit about that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, as far as anything that we might be able to prove aside from the Facebook post\n\nSpeaker 2: Of the police report.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is who and and I don't know if you can look at see who filed this police report or who who reported this and said that, you know, we were\n\nSpeaker 2: That I was giving alcohol\n\nSpeaker 0: to minors. That she was giving alcohol to minors. And then the other thing would be with Melanie Myers. She has emailed and text the city multiple times\n\nSpeaker 2: Trying to get fired.\n\nSpeaker 0: Trying to get her fired. So there should be email and or text messages about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we're the the emails and text messages to the city council to to people involved in the city, that stuff is likely gonna be privileged, because it's not it's not public, and it's it's reaching out to public employees in the scope of their responsibilities. Right? Okay. So that stuff that stuff wouldn't work. The police report is also privileged, but\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It might give us a start. Right? Because if we can if we can find out who made the police report and then we can find instances of them saying similar things, spreading similar rumors outside of the police report, the police report can at least you know, it can point us in a direction. Right? What is what is your Shandra, what is your last name?\n\nIt's Gardner. Gardner. Your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Gardner.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gardner. Okay. Let's see here. Your middle name, Lynette?\n\nSpeaker 2: Name or my maiden name, k r e c h. Sorry. Middle name is McCall.\n\nSpeaker 1: You you kind you kinda cut out there. What was your what's your middle name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My my middle name is McCall. Okay. And my maiden name is Kret, k r e e t h, is my maiden name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. There is absolutely nothing showing up for you. Not even a speeding ticket. Let me oh, maybe I still trouble. Let me try something else here.\n\nOh, there we go. Okay. Still not much. Somebody seeking a civil stalking injunction against you?\n\nSpeaker 2: That was me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you were seeking it. I see. Okay. Sorry. You guys are you guys are breaking up kinda bad here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Is that better?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Way better, actually.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So okay. So the so the civil stock injunction, I can see you were petitioning for one against Larry Monfredi and\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Monfredi.\n\nSpeaker 0: And Robert. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he was, oh, he was represented by Robert. Okay. Who's Larry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Larry was a past employee that worked at the golf course in 2023 oh, 2024, last summer. And he, or he quit in the July, and then he was sending me messages and after messages. And he would come into the clubhouse and scream at me and swear at me and threaten my employees, and then he would, like, say super awful sexual remarks to me. And, I kinda got sick of the city not defending me and helping me through it, so then I went and got a stalking and order injunction filed.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we handed it over to the city attorney at that point, and then he mediated a deal between me and Larry. Mhmm. And the deal is that if he can come up to the golf course and be civil and be polite and not cause problems, then I wouldn't get a restraining order against him or a stop cheating dumpster order against him.\n\nSpeaker 1: K. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. So that's where we currently sit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So here's what we would have to do, and here's what I'm gonna recommend because we're I I I'm I'm not gonna I'm not gonna we're we're go we're technically over a little bit, but I think we'd lost a couple minutes when I thought I was talking to you and I was talking to dead air. So, so but I do I do wanna kinda get to some advice here and wrap up. And I think that have you are you familiar, with grammar requests?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Uh-huh. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the police report already?\n\nSpeaker 2: From which event?\n\nSpeaker 1: From From\n\nSpeaker 2: my civil talk movement or from From the allegations.\n\nSpeaker 1: The allegations about giving alcohol to minors. No. Uh-huh. No. Here's what I would recommend because I think that if we were to take this right now and try to file any kind of action for defamation or anything like that, I don't think there is enough there.\n\nI think that we're I think that it's close. I think that we could put together a complaint that wouldn't necessarily get laughed out of court, but I think that it is it's not clear to me right now. So k. What I And\n\nSpeaker 0: what what would you mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's where I that's where I'm headed. What I think is that I think that if you guys can fill out a grammar request, you can do this online. They're they're pretty self explanatory, and submit a grammar request for that police report or if the police will just give it to you. Sometimes they do. If you contact the police department, ask them for a copy of the report, sometimes they will give it to you.\n\nIf not, they'll send they'll they'll point you to a grammar request anyway. But I would I would fill out a grammar request and do that and find out if the if the person making the report is identified in that grammar request. If it is Okay. Then we have a place to start where we can start digging in and and maybe find some something concrete that we can that we can put together. But without that, it just it seems to me that we have allegations and we have, you know, what I would call, common sense inferences that we could make, but those aren't really enough to file anything in court.\n\nRight? We would need something more concrete than that. Yeah. And so I think that if you wanna get a starting point, I think that the first thing is to, is to is to try to get a grammar request. The second and to to get that police report.\n\nThe second thing is I would maybe go back to the school to the school district, the athletic director, to the, to the principal, and I would ask them for why you were let go. Tell them that, you know Is\n\nSpeaker 0: this something that we need to have in writing that we should do in an email, or can we just go ask them?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would certainly recommend getting it in writing. I would not k. Necessarily recommend that you to that you tell them you've been speaking to attorneys because then they might freak out and be like, well, we better make sure this is, you know\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. I see what you mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. But, but I would I would do it over email or something, get it in writing. And if they say it is because the allegations or because of the, you know, or because of, of rumors going around, then, you know, maybe you're in business. If they say it's something else, if they just say it was, you know, business decision or the relationship wasn't working out or any, you know, whatever, Utah has a right to work state. Right?\n\nAnd so anything like that, you're it's probably gonna be it's gonna make things a lot harder. But if they do if they do point to those rumors or allegations, then there might be something there. So what I'd recommend to you, I don't want I don't want you to retain us to do this stuff for you because it's all stuff you can do yourself, and I don't wanna charge you money for stuff you can do yourself. Right? I'd I'd rather you spend money on stuff that you you can't do, right, and you need to spend money on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do the grammar request, try to get a copy of the police report, and try to get a concrete justification for why you really go from the school district. And I think that if you can get those things and they point to where we think they're gonna point, then give us a callback, and we'll we'll kinda follow-up on this consultation. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Sounds good. We'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Well, like I said, if you find anything else out, give us a call, and, otherwise, good luck to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n",

          "value": "CONSULTATION ANALYSIS REPORT\n\nExecutive Summary:\n- Date and Time: May 21, 2025\n- Participants: Daniel Gardner, Shanna Gardner, Attorney Ryan Nelson\n- Final Grade: B (85%)\n- Overall Score: 85%\n- Retention Status: Not Retained (Matter Resolved During Consultation)\n- Retainer Amount: N/A\n- Strengths: Strong legal knowledge, clear explanation of defamation elements, honest case assessment\n- Weaknesses: Connection issues disrupted flow, limited exploration of emotional impact, minimal follow-up strategy\n\nDetailed Analysis:\n\n1. Consultation Overview\nAttorney Nelson conducted a thorough consultation regarding potential defamation claims stemming from workplace conflicts and rumors affecting Shanna Gardner's employment. The consultation followed a logical structure: fact-gathering, legal framework explanation, application to client's situation, and actionable recommendations. The attorney effectively managed a complex narrative involving multiple potential defendants and a series of interconnected events. The critical moment came when Nelson identified the job loss as the only concrete damages that might support a defamation claim, shifting the consultation from likely rejection to potential viability with additional investigation.\n\n2. Attorney Performance Analysis\nNelson demonstrated strong expertise by clearly explaining the four elements of defamation plus the privilege exception. His statement that \"defamation cases have four elements... the things being said have to be false... published... said with some degree of intent... and there have to be damages\" provided an accessible framework. He effectively applied these principles to the client's situation, honestly assessing the Facebook posts as insufficient evidence while identifying the job termination as potential damages.\n\nNelson built rapport through active listening and acknowledging the small-town dynamics: \"I'm not from Utah, but I am from the rural South, and I know about small town dynamics.\" His need discovery was thorough, asking targeted questions about the termination circumstances. However, he missed opportunities to explore the emotional impact of the situation on the clients.\n\nNelson maintained professional confidence throughout, effectively managing a technical disruption without becoming flustered. His time management was appropriate, focusing on the most legally relevant aspects of a complex narrative.\n\n3. Critical Moments Analysis\nThe turning point came when Nelson identified the job loss as potential damages: \"When you started talking about losing your job at the school district, my ears perked up a little bit.\" This shifted the consultation from likely rejection to potential viability. Nelson effectively managed expectations: \"I don't want to get your hopes up too much here,\" while still offering a path forward. A missed opportunity occurred when the connection dropped, disrupting the flow of the consultation.\n\n4. Retention Analysis\nNo retention occurred as Nelson appropriately recommended self-help steps before investing in legal representation: \"I don't want you to retain us to do this stuff for you because it's all stuff you can do yourself, and I don't wanna charge you money for stuff you can do yourself.\" This demonstrated ethical practice and built trust. The clients responded positively: \"Alright. Sounds good. We'll do that.\" Nelson left the door open for future representation if the preliminary investigation yielded promising results.\n\n5. Improvement Recommendations\nNelson should implement a more structured follow-up plan, perhaps offering a written summary of recommended steps. When technical issues occur, a brief recap would help reestablish context. More exploration of the emotional impact would demonstrate greater empathy. Providing specific guidance on drafting the GRAMA request would add value. Consider offering a scheduled follow-up call to maintain engagement.\n\n6. Comparative Analysis\nNelson's performance aligned with industry best practices in legal knowledge and ethical guidance. His honest assessment of case viability demonstrated integrity. Compared to best practices, he could improve by providing more concrete follow-up steps and written documentation. His approach to recommending self-help steps before retention shows client-centered practice that builds long-term trust."

        "Consult Transcript (Claude)": "Based on the dialogue analysis, I will proceed with the consultation summary:\n\n# Consultation Summary\n\n## Overview\nThe consultation involved attorney Ryan Nelson from Hepworth Legal meeting with Daniel Gardner and his wife Shanna Gardner regarding potential defamation claims. The case centers around workplace conflicts at a golf course where Shanna serves as manager, including allegations and rumors that led to her termination from a school district coaching position. The discussion focused on evaluating whether there are grounds for legal action regarding defamatory statements and their impact on Shanna's employment.\n\n## Action Items\n1. Client to submit GRAMA request for police report regarding alcohol distribution allegations\n2. Client to contact school district (principal/athletic director) via email requesting written explanation for termination\n3. Client to document any additional instances of defamatory statements made outside privileged communications\n4. Client to reconnect with attorney if supporting documentation reveals actionable evidence\n\n## Insights\n- Four key elements required for defamation cases:\n- False statements\n- Publication\n- Intent (negligent or malicious)\n- Damages\n- Facebook posts alone likely insufficient for legal action\n- Job termination provides concrete damages but requires causal connection\n- Privileged communications (police reports, city council communications) may limit available evidence\n- Small town dynamics complicate evidence gathering but require concrete proof\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Obtain police report through GRAMA request or direct police department contact\n2. Secure written termination reasoning from school district\n3. Gather any non-privileged evidence linking specific individuals to harmful statements\n4. Contact attorney's office for follow-up consultation if evidence supports case\n\n## Questions Discussed\n- Whether city council meeting statements are privileged\n- Source and nature of termination decision\n- Extent and impact of Facebook posts\n- Evidence connecting rumors to specific individuals\n- Documentation of damages from defamatory statements\n\n## Timeline\n- 2021: Initial hiring at golf course\n- 2021-2023: Various workplace conflicts\n- 2023: Issues with employee Chacey\n- Recent (1-2 months prior): Facebook posts\n- Current: Police investigation and school district termination\n\n## Conclusion\nThe attorney advised that while elements of a potential defamation case exist, more concrete evidence is needed to proceed. The loss of employment provides damages, but establishing clear links between specific defamatory statements and the termination is crucial. The clients should focus on gathering documentation through GRAMA requests and written communication with the school district before considering legal action.\n",

The consultation flowed logically from problem identification to solution exploration. Caleb effectively explained the legal concept of easement by necessity and the process for obtaining one. The critical turning point came when Caleb recognized the client's hesitation about the full $12,500 retainer and pivoted to offer a $3,000 preliminary assessment option, which secured the retention.\n\n### Attorney Performance Analysis\n\n#### Expertise Demonstration\nCaleb displayed strong knowledge of property law, particularly regarding easements. His explanation of \"easement by necessity\" was clear and thorough: \"Whenever there's an easement there, both properties involved because there's a Servient Estate and then there's a dominant estate.\" He effectively outlined the legal requirements: \"What we would have to determine for you to have a successful easement by necessity is we'd have to find out where this land came from that made it landlocked.\"\n\n#### Sales Technique Evaluation\nCaleb built rapport through attentive listening and demonstrated understanding of the client's situation. His need discovery was thorough, asking clarifying questions about property ownership and zoning. However, his value proposition could have been presented earlier and more explicitly. When the client expressed concern about costs, Caleb skillfully pivoted to offer a lower-cost initial assessment: \"We have another option where what we'll do is we'll take a $3,000 retainer to assess your case.\"\n\n#### Professional Presence Assessment\nCaleb maintained a professional demeanor throughout, though occasionally showed uncertainty: \"I'm going through a few different channels to kinda find some of these answers.\" His communication was generally clear but sometimes included filler words. Time management was adequate, though the pricing discussion came relatively late in the consultation.\n\n#### Client Engagement Analysis\nCaleb established good rapport and maintained client engagement through active listening. He confirmed understanding at key points: \"Yeah. Totally. So first and foremost...\" The client appeared comfortable and engaged throughout, asking relevant follow-up questions that indicated interest.\n\n### Critical Moments Analysis\nThe pivotal moment occurred when Caleb recognized the client's hesitation about the full retainer and offered a preliminary assessment option. This demonstrated adaptability and client-centered service. A missed opportunity was not discussing the preliminary assessment option earlier when the client first expressed cost concerns: \"I also don't wanna spend a ton a ton of money.\"\n\n### Retention Analysis\nThe client retained the firm primarily due to Caleb's expertise demonstration and the flexible approach to engagement. The $3,000 preliminary assessment provided a lower-risk entry point that addressed the client's expressed concern about costs while still moving the matter forward. Caleb effectively closed by confirming the client's preference: \"I'll get that retainer set up for the $3,000 one just to kind of investigate your claim, and then we'll go from there. Is that what you're saying?\"\n\n### Improvement Recommendations\n1. Present pricing options earlier in the consultation\n2. Reduce filler words (\"kinda,\" \"like\") for more authoritative presence\n3. Prepare concise explanations of complex legal concepts\n4. Articulate value proposition more explicitly\n5. Develop a more structured consultation framework to ensure all key points are covered efficiently"

        "Consult Transcript (Claude)": "Based on the dialogue analysis, I can confirm:\nSpeaker 0: Christopher Faerber (Client)\nSpeaker 1: Caleb Marshall (Attorney)\n\n# Consultation Summary\n\n## Overview\nThe consultation focused on a potential property purchase of a landlocked lot that requires easement access through either an HOA road or adjacent property. Christopher Faerber is interested in purchasing the lot to build a residential home but needs to determine the legal feasibility of obtaining necessary access rights. The property is currently inaccessible due to an HOA gate and geographical constraints.\n\n## Action Items\n- Attorney to prepare $3,000 retainer agreement for initial case assessment\n- Research historical property records at County Recorder's office\n- Investigation of property's chain of title\n- Analysis of easement by necessity legal requirements\n- Draft legal memo outlining case viability\n- Send retainer agreement via SignNow platform\n\n## Insights\n- Property is landlocked with no current legal access\n- HOA is currently unwilling to grant voluntary access\n- Easement by necessity requires proving:\n- Historical common ownership\n- Strict necessity for access\n- No other reasonable access options\n- Geographical constraints prevent alternative road construction\n- Property is zoned for residential use\n- Approximate lot size is 0.5 acres\n- Surrounding properties are 1.5 acre lots\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Attorney to send $3,000 retainer agreement\n2. Client to review and sign retainer agreement\n3. Legal team to begin property records research\n4. Analysis of case law regarding easement by necessity\n5. Preparation of assessment memo\n\n## Questions Discussed\n- Current easement status of property\n- Historical ownership records\n- Legal requirements for easement by necessity\n- Cost estimates for legal representation\n- Timeline for research and litigation\n- Access alternatives through adjacent properties\n- HOA involvement and position\n- Property development potential\n\n## Timeline\n- Initial research phase: 2-3 weeks\n- If litigation required:\n- 21-day response period for civil suits\n- Total timeline dependent on opposition response\n- Retainer agreement to be sent by end of business day\n\n## Conclusion\nThe initial consultation established a clear path forward with a two-phase approach:\n1. Initial $3,000 retainer for case assessment and viability\n2. Potential full representation ($12,500 retainer) if case proves viable\n\nThe attorney will provide a detailed analysis of the likelihood of success in obtaining an easement by necessity before the client proceeds with the property purchase. This approach allows for due diligence before committing to full litigation.\n",

        "Transcript Paragraphs Transcript": "\nSpeaker 0: Recording in progress.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 0: Hey, Caleb.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you? Doing well, Chris. How are you doing today?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Not too bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good.\n\nSpeaker 0: For being with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Of course. So a few things before we get going is I'm one of the licensed attorneys here, and I'll be going through your consultation. This conversation is being recorded for note taking purposes. And everything we talk about is gonna be confidential.\n\nNothing's gonna leave this office unless, of course, you give us written permission to share anything that we talk about. Or if anything you tell us makes us think that there's a a serious risk of harm to someone, then we have to Right. Report that. But, otherwise, that's that. Do you have any questions about any of those things?\n\nSpeaker 0: Nope. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Sounds good. So from our notes, it looks like you're interested in buying a an ice well, like, a a landlocked piece of property, and it's landlocked by an HOA. So can you give me just a little bit of, like, kind of a a timeline details, reasons, all that stuff?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So I I just, I stumbled upon a the property a couple weeks ago, and I just been kinda doing some due diligence, looking up the HOA, talking with my realtor. I'm currently selling a few properties to kind of, you know, have capital to kinda purchase something, potentially build, that type of thing. So I saw this this lot. I've walked through it, up to it, through the gate, and, it it's a very billable lot.\n\nBut then kinda talking to, the owner of the lot through the my real estate agent, they're saying, hey. It you know, the HOA is not really playing ball. It's not part of the current HOA, and it's it's kind of landlocked between the HOA and this other piece of property from the main main road there, to that cul de sac. I don't know if you you you see the the the actual photo that I sent over, but, yeah, that that's it in a nutshell. And I'm kind of, like, trying to figure out what my options are if the HOA, is it willing to play ball because it doesn't seem like there's any other way to really get to the property.\n\nBecause if you even go through the other property that's close to the the road that's not part of the HOA, it's greater than 30 degree, 30% incline, around. Right? So the ridgeline would kinda prevent that cutting in a road, to bypass the HOA road.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the easiest way would be just to be a part of the HOA, which it doesn't sound like they want this property to be a part of the HOA. There's a gate preventing, the use of that road, so it's it's basically kind of part of the HOA. So I don't know how you would basically kind of navigate that. Like, they can't force somebody to, the court to allow somebody to be part of an HOA, I'm assuming, even though you can get potential easement to the property. So I that's kinda what I'm trying to figure out.\n\nLike, is it is it possible? And what, you know, what's the timeline, to get that through, like, the court system or working with the HOA, that type of thing? And rough mag rough order of magnitude, how much would it cost in, like, legal fees?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's kinda what I'm trying to understand at this point. Okay. Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Totally. So first and foremost, the the I have one question, and then I'll follow-up with what really can happen here. As far as you're aware, is are there any easements that have been recorded that are currently attached to the property?\n\nSpeaker 0: I yeah. That that I don't I'm not aware of, but I don't think so. The preview the current owner has tried to approach the HOA and they're not really playing balls. There is no easement as far as I understand it at this point. And that's going off of text messages that I received from my real estate agent that she basically copied and pasted, over to me that were in the email that I sent Liz.\n\nMhmm. So I would say there probably isn't any. This lot was there when this HOA was formed, but the HOA was a bunch of, you know, one and a half acre properties and this one is just a half acre piece of property. Even though the, acre and a half properties only roughly three quarters of an acre is billable on those lots. This is actually in the billable section, because of the slope that's behind behind the property.\n\nYeah. So, hopefully, that kinda answers that. I I'm not really sure. Mhmm. I know there's discussions.\n\nThey say they were basically unwilling to voluntarily give it, an easement or access. So that is the court case right there, and she said the other parcel owners to either side of her, they she has not tried to get an easement from them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So is someone currently living on this this property or just owning it?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's just a piece of land. It's just a piece of\n\nSpeaker 1: land. Okay. And so it is zoned for building, you said, for for residential use?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And so does does the owner live beside it at all, or is the owner just\n\nSpeaker 0: I I don't believe so. I don't believe so.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to to kinda figure that one out because if someone was already living there, I would say that there would have to be some kind of agreement worked out already. Otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense. It'd be kind of impossible to to get in and out. There's no there's no reason to get easement through the other property in the HOA because the road to the HOA is right beside this property.\n\nSpeaker 0: So, like, you could basically cut in a driveway, if you were given permission by the HOA. And then I don't know if you see that photo, but there's this Scott and Annette, Trouville. I think that actually got approved. They, got approval through the county to basically open up another three plots of development off of that main cul de sac road. I just kinda stumbled upon that today.\n\nMhmm. This this portion of the land is not part of that approval process because it's really unbuildable, because of the slope lines. Mhmm. So, yes, that to me, you can't really circumvent the gate because there's no way to cut another road through there through the Scott And Nanette, Family Trust property. And the only way to access the property is from the HOA access, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. So\n\nSpeaker 0: That makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. It it makes sense. I mean, it I'm just there's a lot that goes on through my head when we're dealing with these kinds of consultations where I'm thinking about what I'm thinking legally plus taking in the information you're saying, and it it just takes me a second to kinda process all that. But, yes, it makes sense.\n\nSo, generally, what happens in these circumstances is there is what's called an easement by necessity. This is one because there there are various forms of easements, but there's the ones that you can get in into, consensually with people, you know, if the other owners are willing to work with you. We've already established they're not, but that's generally how that works. And then the other one that works outside of some other circumstances that don't really matter here is what's called an easement by necessity, which basically shows that there is no other way for this property to be used unless there's some form of, ingress or egress that's added to it, basically. And so then there's kind of a court imposed easement.\n\nIt's the court finds the least restrictive means. So it could be the property to the right. It could be to the HOA. You know what I mean? Like, it it all depends on what the court decides is the least restrictive.\n\nBut what happens is they say because this is useless otherwise, it needs something. So somebody just kinda has to give because property interests are pretty much just protected by the community at large. So the community at large kinda has to suck it up sometimes. So that's kind of the gist of how those work. I do need to see if that works when it comes to buying a new plot of land.\n\nOftentimes, when you have a plot of land that gets property bought up around it and then that starts to land lock you, those are pretty quick ways to get an easement by necessity. Like, there's very little argument about it. Sometimes there's an issue of, like, well, maybe this could have been prevented. And in this case, where you are interested in buying it but there's already no way to have a road at it, I don't think that that is gonna be something where they're gonna be like, nah. You don't get one.\n\nBecause this land would still be landlocked regardless. Basically, you would only be left with the option. And by you, I mean, whomever owns this actually would basically be left with the option of selling it to the HOA developers or whomever else would want it, and that's not like, you shouldn't they shouldn't be restricted to that only. So give me a minute to kinda look into this a little bit more just to see. Yeah.\n\nIt seems kinda\n\nSpeaker 0: it seems a little unethical to kinda go down. Yeah. I get what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll give you a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So let's see here. K. Okay. So is this property this is something that you wanna use for investment purposes or for residential purposes?\n\nSpeaker 0: I would like to build a home. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it I'm not necessarily saying it matters, but it might. If, you know, if you're just buying it to buy it for now, then who knows what matters down the line.\n\nSpeaker 0: As part of this year that we're we're selling we sold a condo. We have some savings. My my dad is selling a cabin down at Duck Creek. We're gonna combine the the the money and either buy a property or build build something. So we've looked at what land up Immigration Canyon.\n\nWe've looked at property up Immigration Canyon. We currently reside up Immigration Canyon. We like it up here. So that that's the goal is to build a home. And it wouldn't be it would be more of a modest hump compared to some of the homes that are up there, like, 3,500 square feet.\n\nSome of these are probably eight or 9,000 square feet, or large homes, you know, 3,000,000 plus homes. So, yeah, that's the goal.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going through a few different channels to kinda find some of these answers because I know sort of what the general idea is for the easement by necessity, but figuring out if there's any kind of, like, subtle potential roadblock ahead of time is kind of important. I wouldn't wanna be like, oh, yeah. It should be super easy and then be like, oh, actually, it's impossible. So, like, I don't yeah. Just give me one second here.\n\nOh, gosh. Oh, gosh. Okay. So some of what's coming up is, like, the specifics about it that'll that'll be involved for proving this. So if we were to try to go through this, basically, what would happen is we'd have to petition the court.\n\nSo this would just be a lawsuit, essentially. But instead of suing someone, we're just petitioning the court to try to go through this. So it's like that, but it's not suing someone. But then we have to prove that, the property was completely landlocked. And in part of that, that also shows, like, a level of there was it was a okay.\n\nSorry. I'm I'm jumping ahead. Technically, what the elements consist of for this is you have to prove that there was once common ownership of the property, that the property was also once attached to a separate piece of property owned by the same person, and that when they were sold off, that was, like, at the severance, that's when they started to be it became landlocked or something of that nature. I there may be some wiggle room there, but I won't know unless I look at some of the case law. There has to be a strict necessity.\n\nBasically, what this means is there cannot be like, it has to be 100% landlocked. And by that, I don't just mean, like because, like, technically, you could probably drive from here to there or whatever, like, through the HOA. But since you don't have access to the HOA because they own it, not you, the HOA, I mean, not the the parcel, that would technically not count as a legal form of ingress or egress, because you'd need their permission. And part of this is that there can't be if I didn't say it already is what I meant, is there can be no legal access to a public road. So even if there was already an existing road from the HOA to this property, but they didn't give you permission to go through, then technically, that wouldn't count as legal access.\n\nAnd so here, what it would mean is if you are able to build a driveway to the main road or something to the main road that doesn't cut through in a way that, like, is reasonable, they may require you to do that. But if it's unreasonable, then there's probably a a fair, I don't wanna say\n\nSpeaker 0: Other stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like we have. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's no way to there's no way to do that because you have to go through somebody else's property. You'd also need egress for through that property. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 1: And so and either way, you'd have to get that. So I get a another easement by necessity, essentially. So so what this means, I guess, is\n\nSpeaker 0: this all Preferably, I'd like a driveway that doesn't go through the HOA. But, geographically, I don't think that's possible based on, you know, the topographic maps. Right? Like, I I don't think you can build another driveway beside the HOA around the gate to that property through that family trust. I don't think there's enough room there to kinda make that happen.\n\nI don't think you could build a road.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and I don't know to what extent. Like, without knowing exactly where everything came from, I can't give you a 100% answers right now, but here's the gist of how it would go. So whenever there's an easement and I'm sorry. This is gonna be kind of an annoying, like, explanation, I guess, so bear with me. Whenever there's an easement there, both properties involved because there's a Servient Estate and then there's, like, a dominant estate.\n\nIs that I believe that's how that's phrased. It's been a minute since I've had to think about it in those. Yeah. Dominant estate and serving estate. So the dominant estate is your property.\n\nWe're just gonna call it yours for the sake of argument just to keep it faster. So Yeah. Your property is gonna be the dominant one because that's the one that is served by the other estate. Because what you have to do for an easement is you're basically encroaching on somebody else's property to use it for some purpose. Either they've given you access for it or one of the other ways you can get an easement like this.\n\nAnd so what we would have to determine for you to have a successful easement by, necessity is we'd have to find out where this land came from that made it landlocked, basically. So, like, whoever sold it, carved it off, that made it landlocked.\n\nSpeaker 0: How do you how do you figure that out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Records. Going through the records. So, basically, just going back through the historical records, seeing who sold what, when, and where, and just all of that.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I'm sure it was originally one huge plot of land, I would think. Right? And they they subdivided it, I'm assuming. Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would I would imagine. But it's also possible, like, in this case that this this piece of property like, let's just say for the sake of argument that the the property the trust property right there was the one that owned it originally even if it's not them specifically, but someone way back owned it just for the sake of ease. We'll say that it was them that owned it, and then years ago, they decided to carve out that little square for somebody else, whomever. The current owner, someone two owners back. I don't know.\n\nSo they decided to carve that out. They gave it to them. Well, at that point in time is when it became land locked. So that's when we would look and say, this is where things happen that made it land locked. So this is the the stuff we have to work with.\n\nSo then what happens is the two pieces of property that we're working within the lawsuit is your piece of property and in this case, would be the trust property, which I don't know if that's actually the case, but that's who it was because that's when it became landlocked. So whenever that was, that's when it became landlocked. And as soon as it's landlocked, then we have to say cutting through this property, essentially, through this original one, which is now the Serbian property, what's the least, what's the word? What's the least impactful? It's not the word I'm looking for, but I don't wanna spend time looking for perfect words.\n\nLike, Like, what's the least impactful way that's gonna be able to make it so we can get a way of in and out on this to this property? And so that would be whichever property is the one that ultimately landlocked you seems to be the one\n\nSpeaker 0: Does it does it need to be a property? Can it just be permitted to go to a or an HOA road that's already there? Right? So\n\nSpeaker 1: That that's what I'm kind of explaining here is when it when it with the easement and all that stuff and with the the elements of the law, it's basically whichever property originally made it landlocked. So whomever owned it and then sent it away and sold it.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's a Serbian property is what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one that's gonna be the one that you have to basically say, like, because of these people, this time, whatever. It doesn't matter who it was. But you just say because of the owner at the time when this happened, this is now landlocked. So we need some kind of an easement through their property to the main road. So if it was the people that had purchased the HOA for development, then we would have to go that direction or the surrounding area.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah. So okay. Yeah. Alright.\n\nMakes sense. K. So if it is the HOA, you probably just go to the HOA, road. If it's the family trust, you're probably gonna have to go around the gate, to the main road, basically, to get easement. Okay.\n\nMakes sense. Alright. So how do how do we proceed doing some you know, looking at records? And, you know, like, I I'd like to proceed, because I feel like the property is a good value. I feel like it's a lot of headache.\n\nIt could take a while to get e spent. I'm not in a hurry. I also don't wanna spend a ton a ton of money, but I'm willing to spend some, right, to get to the bottom of this to think, hey, we have a pretty solid case here. I I'm pretty sure we're gonna be able to get easement to this property. How what does it what does it take, money wise and time wise to get to that point where we feel comfortable?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I will need to double check. So this is just gonna be kind of a we'll just call it an estimate quote for now because I don't I don't know because I don't think we've done one of these recently.\n\nSpeaker 0: I won't hold it to you. I mean, you can just give me, like, a, you know, plus or minus contingency of 20% or something. You know? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll say, generally, based on how we'll do a lot of our retainers, I will say that this is likely a base retainer of anywhere from 7,500 to 10,000, and that just depends. And you may be familiar with retainers, but if not, I'm just gonna explain it real quick anyway. The retainer is not a flat fee, so you'd pay us whatever money that we request for the for the retainer upfront just so we have money to work with. That money goes into a separate trust account. We bill against it at our hourly rate, and then whatever's left over, if there's anything left over when we're done representing you in the matter, gets returned to you.\n\nSo if everything goes smoothly, you can get more back. If it's a very protracted thing, we may need more beyond the the initial retainer, but that's generally how that works out. But it likely since there's the factor that going actually, like, into the court and petitioning them for something, probably anywhere from 7,500 to 10,000, but I could be overestimating. So when I'm able to talk to one of my managing attorneys, I'll be able to let you know for sure. Okay.\n\nBut\n\nSpeaker 0: that's generally Doing doing doing so many homework and stuff, would it be somebody like you or it'd be like a clerk that's doing it, at a lower rate, that type of thing? I mean, what what are you thinking there?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we do have some paralegals here, and they help. And their their rate so, like, my hourly rate is $300 an hour. Their hourly rate's in, like, the 100 and some odd. I don't remember exactly what, but, like, I think one of them is, like, a 175, and I think our newest would be a little less than that. It all depends on what parts of research needs to happen.\n\nSo, like, case law research and all of that is going to be me. That's just gonna be one of the attorneys, and that's how that always goes because we're the ones that have to be able to do that. As far as going to the records, that could be one of our paralegals or it could be one of us. I'm not positive because I don't know. I don't think there's a requirement that it's one of us.\n\nIt's just a matter of manpower and availability and stuff like that. So it may just be whoever has to go on and go do that. But if we need to, we can have one of our paralegals do it, try to help cut down on that. But, yeah, that's\n\nSpeaker 0: so Is there a is there a place where I can is it public information that I can go and look at records?\n\nSpeaker 1: County records. You go to the county that the property is located in. You go to the the county recorder's office, and then you can ask for it depends on the county. Each Each county kinda does things differently. Some will charge you some money to be able to access the records.\n\nSome may make you put in a full blown grammar request, so you have to wait x amount of time to get it back. Some may let you go in, and you can go look through the index right away. It just depends on the specific county. But if that is something you wanted to do, that's something that you can do is you can go in and pull. I would recommend was just curious.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: At this point, I'd recommend just pulling, what's the word, copies of, like, the, basically, the history of the property. There's a word for it, but I can't think of it right now. But the history of the property, that'll just say, you know, where it came from, whatever. Because, originally, there's gonna be a point where it was deeded from someone to be the way that it is now. And once you hit that point, basically, is when you're able to say, like, this is when it was landlocked and it was made by this person, which means you can find that person then and then see what they had and surrounding and then see who has it now or if they are the ones that still have it like that.\n\nSo but yeah. So that's basically where it's at. Let me see if I can get an answer at least on this kind of thing, on, like, a, the retainer. Do you have any other questions right now about the general\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Not right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Hopefully, someone gets back to me quickly on that. And then if not, I can always just email you or something like that. But yeah. So that's that's about where we're at is we would just do some some research there, some research in the in the, with the case law and stuff.\n\nAnd then I do I think it actually is still considered a lawsuit against the property owner that we would have to get the easement from because it's affecting their property interests. But, ultimately, if we're successful, it comes down to the court just being like, yeah. This property doesn't have any way to get in or out. So here you go. So\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah.\n\nIt it definitely sounds doable, but we gotta figure out, like, you know, where the easement's coming from and who's kinda responsible from it based on the history of the property. And that's some, you know, digging in some legwork. Yeah. Let me know what you find out, internally there. And, yeah, I'll be in touch with you, and I'm sure I'm past that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And as soon as I get that figured out too, we'll be able to send you oh, looks like someone might have no. They didn't. That was not as helpful as I thought. Actually, give me a I think someone might be available.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just give me one second. Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. I'd rather get you answers as quick as possible. Okay. Sorry about that. So after talking to them, I guess it's the base retainer that they've seen for these kinds of cases lately has been $12.05, actually.\n\nSo 12,500. Okay. There's a potential, like, if it's not so hard to because some of the sometimes with this, it gets very litigious, and so the other side might really try to fight it pretty hard. Other sides may not be as so. Like, they may not wanna do it immediately, but once it's all said and done, they may be like, well, whatever.\n\nSo twelve five would probably be the base. And then from there, may may get some back, may go over. It just depends on the situation. So Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Yeah. Sounds good. So, how do we go about, you know, going to next steps if I'm interested in that?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we can I can get a retainer set up for you after this? It'll have the amount. It'll have the scope of of the litigation and stuff like that. I'll send it to you. It'll show up in your email.\n\nIt won't be from Hepworth. It'll be from I think it's sign now maybe. And it it will have a live link that you can use to sign and, like, it should have a payment link with it as well. So if you're interested, you can do that. If not, you can let it sit.\n\nI don't think it really expires beyond whenever we just decide to, like, oh, it's been out for too long. We'll we'll kill it. But I don't think it expires otherwise. So if you wanna leave it for a week or wanna jump on it today, you have that flexibility.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah. Sounds great. K. Yeah.\n\nSo let's let's do that, I guess. And, yeah, I'll talk to my wife about it. Mhmm. And we'll kinda go from there. I do have the money, so, yeah, it shouldn't be a problem to get started if we're if we're looking to get started quickly.\n\nMhmm. Is this something you guys could, you know, kinda jump on if we're like, hey. Let's let's go with this. We're good to go. Well, we something that you would\n\nSpeaker 1: It's definitely something we can get initiated as I mean, as quickly as we can. And by that, I mean, like, it might take us a couple weeks to really get things, like, rolling just because we have other things that we are currently dealing with. But that I mean, we would let it go for forever. But there is going to be the little thing of, like, how the lawsuit operates. So, like, generally speaking, whenever there's a civil suit, you file a complaint to the other side, they have twenty one days to respond, and most parties will let it get pretty close to that twenty one days.\n\nYep. So procedurally, there's only so much we can do. But as far as what we can do, we can probably get on it pretty quickly. I don't see why not.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I mean, I'm I'm more interested right now in, looking at the records and and saying, hey. We got a good case here. We think we're gonna win. We're gonna be able to get, you know, easement of its necessity, whatever that thing's called.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: At that point, like, I'd be comfortable purchasing the lot. Right? Yes. So that's what I'm trying to look at is is that point in time. Is that something that we could probably achieve in a few weeks?\n\nIs is that what do you think of there?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want, tech we have another option where what we'll do is we'll take a $3,000 retainer to assess your case, like, literally just, like, do the research essentially. And then whatever's left from that, of course, we're fine. Same same principle with those retainers. But we can do that as well if you wanted to retain us for that to do the research basically around the case and everything to see if you have a viable option. We would dig into the to the records.\n\nWe would dig into the case law, see how everything goes, and then we draft up a memo for you that would explain everything based on our research, what we think, and what the potential cost and everything would be moving forward and all that. So\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Sounds good. Probably probably do that.\n\nSo, yeah, just send me some information over and, I'll work with that person and then we'll kinda go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good. So I'll I'll draft up or I'll get that retainer set up for the $3,000 one just to kind of investigate your claim, and then we'll go from there. Is that what you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Sounds good. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just wanna make sure so I don't do something that you don't want. Alrighty. I'll send that over after this. It may take a little bit. If you don't get it by, I don't know, five or six tonight, then make sure to send us an email because sometimes our system just gives us problems.\n\nYou know? So\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Alright. Yeah. Sounds good. Appreciate it, Caleb.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Of course. It was a pleasure meeting you, and looking forward to working with you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Alright. Thank you. Yep. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: You as well. Bye. Bye.\n",

Attorney to send $3,000 retainer agreement\n2. Client to review and sign retainer agreement\n3. Legal team to begin property records research\n4. Analysis of case law regarding easement by necessity\n5. Preparation of assessment memo\n\n## Questions Discussed\n- Current easement status of property\n- Historical ownership records\n- Legal requirements for easement by necessity\n- Cost estimates for legal representation\n- Timeline for research and litigation\n- Access alternatives through adjacent properties\n- HOA involvement and position\n- Property development potential\n\n## Timeline\n- Initial research phase: 2-3 weeks\n- If litigation required:\n- 21-day response period for civil suits\n- Total timeline dependent on opposition response\n- Retainer agreement to be sent by end of business day\n\n## Conclusion\nThe initial consultation established a clear path forward with a two-phase approach:\n1. Initial $3,000 retainer for case assessment and viability\n2.

The HOA has created a plan to build a new plot of development off of the property, but it is unclear if a easement is opened. The process is a process that involves petitioning the court and proving the property is attached to a separate property owned by the same person. The goal is to build a home and a lawsuit is necessary to prove it. The process is a process that involves petitioning the court and proving the property is attached to a separate property owned by the same person.

          "value": "# CONSULTATION ANALYSIS REPORT\n\n## Executive Summary:\n- Date: July 1, 2025\n- Participants: Patricia Lau (Client), Caleb Marshall (Attorney)\n- Final Grade: B (83%)\n- Retention Status: Not Retained (No explicit commitment)\n- Retainer Amount: $5,000 (mentioned but not secured)\n\n**Strengths**: Strong legal knowledge, good rapport building, clear explanation of legal concepts, professional demeanor\n**Weaknesses**: Missed closing opportunity, limited value proposition, insufficient urgency creation, minimal follow-up planning\n\n## Detailed Analysis:\n\n### Consultation Overview\nAttorney Marshall demonstrated solid expertise in HOA law while addressing Patricia's concerns about unfulfilled amenities and financial accountability. The consultation flowed logically from issue identification to potential legal remedies. Key discussion points included breach of contract claims, unjust enrichment, developer control timelines, and financial accountability requirements. The critical moment occurred when Patricia asked about verifying financial records, indicating serious consideration of pursuing the matter.\n\n### Attorney Performance Analysis\n**Expertise Demonstration**: Marshall effectively explained legal concepts in accessible terms, particularly regarding breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. He provided clear information about developer control timelines: \"There are three general situations in which a developer can retain control... it ends at the earlier of when the developer no longer owns any lots or development rights or seven years after the developer stops offering lots for sale.\"\n\n**Sales Technique**: Marshall built rapport by acknowledging Patricia's desire for an amicable resolution. His need discovery was thorough, asking \"What does a resolution look like to you?\" However, his value proposition when introducing the $5,000 retainer was underdeveloped, focusing on process rather than outcomes.\n\n**Professional Presence**: Marshall maintained a confident, professional demeanor throughout. His communication was clear and he effectively managed time while allowing Patricia to fully express concerns.\n\n**Client Engagement**: Marshall maintained strong engagement, confirming understanding and addressing all questions. He effectively validated Patricia's concerns about financial accountability: \"You are entitled to that because the HOA itself is organized like a corporation. And so as someone who owns property there, you are a shareholder.\"\n\n### Critical Moments Analysis\nThe pivotal moment came when discussing next steps. While Marshall suggested sending a demand letter, he didn't create sufficient urgency or clearly articulate why immediate legal representation would be beneficial. When Patricia asked about verifying financial records, Marshall missed an opportunity to position the firm as essential to this process.\n\n### Retention Analysis\nDespite strong rapport and legal expertise, Marshall didn't secure retention. His closing technique was passive: \"if you wanted to retain us to send a letter...\" rather than a more directive approach. He explained the retainer process but didn't emphasize unique value or create urgency. When Patricia expressed appreciation at consultation end, Marshall responded with a passive invitation rather than a specific next step: \"if you need anything else... we're more than happy to help.\"\n\n### Improvement Recommendations\n1. Develop stronger closing techniques with specific next-step recommendations\n2. Create more urgency around potential legal issues\n3. Strengthen value proposition by emphasizing outcomes rather than processes\n4. Implement a specific follow-up plan at consultation conclusion\n5. Practice transitioning from information-giving to commitment-seeking\n6. Develop concrete examples of successful similar cases to share with clients"

So I'm calling for your your consultation that you scheduled.\n\nA few quick things before we get underway is I'm one of the licensed attorneys here, and I'll be going over your consultation today. The conversation will be recorded.\n\nSpeaker 0: Tell me tell me your name again. I apologize. It went really fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh. I wanna make sure\n\nSpeaker 0: I wrote it down and\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Speaking to you correctly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good. My name is Caleb Marshall.\n\nSpeaker 0: Caleb. Okay. C a l e b.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on\n\nSpeaker 0: Marshall. Thank you. Mhmm. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Of course. And, this conversation is being recorded for note taking purposes. And everything we talk about is gonna be confidential. So nothing's gonna leave this office unless, of course, you give us written permission to share anything from this conversation.\n\nOr if something you tell us makes us think that there's a serious risk of harm to someone, then we have to respond or report that. But otherwise, everything's confidential. Do you have any questions about any of that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I do have a question. Does your firm have expertise in HOA law?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I mean, that's sort of the short answer. Is I guess, to what extent are you looking for expertise in this?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I don't know if you had a chance to review the letter that I had prepared that I was gonna send to the, developer for the project that we bought into, which outlined my concern. Did you get a chance to read that letter?\n\nSpeaker 1: Generally I mean, yes. I did. But, generally, we don't really look through the documents until the the consultation itself. That's just part of the consultation is going through those things. But today, the given the time frame in which I got them, I was able to give give them kind of a once over beforehand.\n\nSo, yes, I was able to go through that. What is your question then about all that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, basically, you know, before I send before I send the letter to them, I kinda wanted to get an understanding of what my where my legal standing is in this whole situation. Because like I said, you know, we're almost two years into when we closed escrow on the buildings, and each building is 18 units. And between my husband, myself, and my son, we own and some minor partners, we own about four buildings.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: At a community called The Yard in American Fork. And when we bought into this community, which is five years ago, during COVID, we were promised that this community would have certain amenities, you know, like pool clubhouse, leasing office, dog park, blah blah blah. And so far, we're almost two years in, and there's been none of that. But yet from the moment we closed escrow, they started charging HOA fees. And then now they're saying instead of providing the clubhouse and the pool and everything else, they're gonna they're gonna put in a pickleball court and a barbecue, which is worth nothing really compared to you know?\n\nAnd it also mixes less competitive. So the one question I have is, do we what legal standing do we have to basically compel them? Or or how obligated are them to deliver on these amenities, I guess, is the question. And the second concern I have is the lack of accountability on the HOA dues that's been collected.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So first, to answer I guess to answer the first question is the CC and Rs in a in an HOA act as a contract. And that means that if they are not living up to their end of the contract, then they are in breach of the contract. So to an extent, you would have a breach of contract claim against them if they've made promises and they're not keeping them, which is what it sounds like based on the letter, and and if they have no intention of of keeping them. Now there could be a little bit of a caveat there with, like, development and all that stuff.\n\nBut the fact that you've been paying dues for amenities that you haven't been receiving also opens up the door for what's known as an unjust enrichment claim, where, basically, they're receiving money. You know, they're receiving a benefit and you're not receiving a benefit even though there was an agreement that both of you would confer a benefit to the other. So, basically, they're just getting a benefit and you're getting nothing. So Right. That's where unjust enrichment comes from.\n\nSo those are just sort of, like, the the some of the basic ones that are are right there. Based on this I mean, other than the CC and Rs and just regular, like, real estate documents, were there any agreements between you and the HOA when you were talking to them or the developers, I guess?\n\nSpeaker 0: Basically and this is the thing too. And because we live in Southern California. In California and I'm and I'm the licensed real estate broker. And by the way, one of the developers is also an attorney himself. He's the one that's in charge of drafting of all the documents and stuff.\n\nSo I know in California with regard to HOA, you know, their HOAs are supposed to require an annual audit of all the funds and provide the county all the funds. I believe in Utah, they don't require that, but members are allowed to request, a financial report or a financial accounting of all the funds. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. You are. And I believe the CC and Rs themselves provide a a you know, say that you're allowed to at least request for this information and then it can be given to you if they're not required to give, like, an annual audit of any sort. But yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and another thing too was in California, when you buy into a community with an HOA, they're required to deliver the CCRs within three days of your purchase agreement. But we didn't receive the PC and finance and I were the first ones to close escrow. We bought in the building too. And we didn't receive the CC and Rs, I think, even till either I think either, like, maybe even after the close ups or I have to chase them down to get it.\n\nSo so there's a lot, you know, there's a lot that was based on trust, because we met them. They seem really honest. We're a religious belief. Right? We're all LDS.\n\nAnd, and and they seem like really nice guys, and they are really nice guys. Over the years, we've built a nice friendship with them. You know? As a matter of fact, one of them is even helping us renovate a second home in Provo. You know?\n\nSo that's why, you know, I wanna make sure that I address this carefully and respectfully. And like I said, I'm hoping to resolve this without having to go to litigation. You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. So at this point one second. Sorry. I was just typing something in.\n\nI didn't wanna lose my train of thought as I was doing so. So as far as dealing with this, I guess it depends on, like, to what extent you want to deal with this. Because like you said, you wanna make sure that you're doing it amicably, which is always a good thing. It's never good to just get aggressive and, you know, try and attack people, especially if you're trying to address something initially. You know, if you just start guns blazing, you can go south real quick.\n\nBut to what extent are you hoping I guess, what do you wanna get out of this? What does a resolution look like to you?\n\nSpeaker 0: My resolution, to be honest with you, is I want them to provide me with a timeline on when they're gonna deliver. Because we we talked to another partner, another owner of in this complex. My son knows another owner in the complex here in Southern California, and he recently talked to Greg, one of the developers. And he said that now that they're still, they're still trying to find some way to get the pool and clubhouse. Because what happened was the land was supposed to provide the land in which they developed these 12 buildings, was supposed to have enough space for a clubhouse and a pool.\n\nAnd then supposedly, they sold the land they they claimed the developer sold the land to Doctor Horton and that they were the Doctor Horton was gonna build a pool and the clubhouse for us to share. And then in the end, we're not sharing it for whatever reason. So I heard that they might be asking for too much money. Mhmm. So it's what it is is we want we wanna go confirm that we're gonna get these amenities in writing on a timeline.\n\nAnd then two, I want some accountability of all the funds that's been correct collected because it's been over half a million dollars\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And more, really, that's been collected in the past, you know, what is it, twenty months, twenty one months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know? So what what what happened to that money? You know? And I also to be honest with you, I also because right now, their wife are running the HOA and the property management company. So not only are they collecting the HOA dues, but they're also collecting the the leasing the property management the leasing fees.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm. Probably\n\nSpeaker 0: the end of the monthly 8%. So they're really making a lot of money off of this. See, what happened with the buying that they referenced, that we referenced, was actually underwritten and funded by another investor. So then they decided to recreate the same community on a little bit of smaller scale because the other community had 23 buildings. This community will have 12 buildings.\n\nThey themselves are supposed to provide the money to build the pool and the clubhouse and everything else, and now they're not delivering on that. So so those are the so I feel like there's some conflict and interest there. I really want to build you I would really prefer another company to handle the HOA and maybe even a different a different leasing company to handle the property management side of it so that you avoid any conflict of interest. You know? Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I get you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. And I heard from a friend that's in this business that works a lot of multifamily housing communities. He said that he's beginning to see a lot of that. Some of these developers, because the market's softening, they're getting squeezed or they're trying to make ends meet, and they're digging into these funds that they really shouldn't. You know?\n\nI don't know if they are. I'm not saying these people are, but it's but I just want some accountability and transparency as to what happened to all the money that's been collected. You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Definitely. And the nice thing is you're entitled to that because the the HOA itself is is I mean, it is an org not an organization. It's organized like a corporation. And so Right.\n\nAs someone who owns property there, you are a shareholder. You are entitled to the accounting. Like, that's just the way that things are. So Right. You are able to request that.\n\nIf they deny it, you say, no. You're going to give it to me because I'm entitled to it. Right. Like, your own documents say it. The law says it.\n\nLike, I'm entitled to it. So and but that's you know, you can still do that nicely. You don't have to say anything rude. But, of course, if they decide not to play nice, then you can respond accordingly. That doesn't mean Right.\n\nBut, but, yeah, at this point, like, it looks like that there is definitely an opportunity for recourse if you if they decide that they're not gonna work with you. You know what I mean? So one, you do you are entitled to an accounting of what those fees like, where they're going and what they're doing with them. And if they don't give that to you, then Mhmm. You know, you can ask for and you can tell them that you are actually entitled to them.\n\nAnd then if they do give them to you and you look through it and you're like, some of this doesn't seem right, you can go further at that point and kind of, you know, bring it up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: As far as potential conflicts of interest, I would have to do a little digging on some of that to see to what extent the developers are allowed to remain in control of the HOA because there is a point. Is development or yeah. Is is the community itself still in development, or is it complete?\n\nSpeaker 0: 10 of the 12 buildings have been completed. The last two buildings actually will go to the two brothers. They each will have one of the buildings. Okay. So, so they themselves will be will own one of the buildings too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And the wife of Brian, who is the attorney developer, the older brother, is in charge of the HOA. Her name was associated with HOA. I think she's in charge of the HOA.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So is she, like like, the president of the board or something at this point? Or\n\nSpeaker 0: We had no idea. There's been no communication substantially whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We've\n\nSpeaker 0: just been collecting the money every month. So we pay about, you know, close to 3,600 a month. And we've been paying that for, what, twenty, twenty one months\n\nSpeaker 1: on\n\nSpeaker 0: two buildings well, three, four buildings. You know? And like I said, there's just us alone. You know? So, like, we think about all the money that's collected, like, $45,000 a year.\n\nYou know? It's been almost two years. It's twenty one months. You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So where's the money go? You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Exactly. Yep. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAt this point, definitely asking for that. And, also, when you're asking saying, hey. Can you give us, like, a clear breakdown of of who's in charge and why? You know, say, like, at this point, why why are you guys allowed to have people in charge, like, to be in these positions? And why is it not more of a traditional setup where we're taking people from the community itself?\n\nMhmm. It's my understanding that there's, and I have to look into the specifics of this, but it's my understanding that there's an extent where when the developers are still developing, they're sort of able to act in that capacity for a while. So I I think that that may be part of what's at issue, but that's I'd I'd like I said, I'd have to do a little more digging to know for certain what the deal is with\n\nSpeaker 0: that. But\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm. But that's just one of those. That's just kinda how it is in that regard. But, with everything else, like I said, there there really is, I think, enough to at least bring bring an action against them. I'm not saying you want to sue them right now and you wanna have those issues.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what it does by having those things is with a letter that you can send or if you wanted to retain us or another attorney to to send a demand letter, it would have kind of the legal basis behind it saying like, hey. Here are the things that I see going wrong here. And if we can't figure something out, then I'm gonna have to move forward with some kind of legal recourse because I can't afford to keep hemorrhaging money for no reason. Like, this that it's kind of ridiculous. So, and that's the gist of where that would be.\n\nSo I think I think at that point, having the potential for these claims and just saying, hey. I just want I just want some, accountability. I just want some transparency. I'm not trying to start a fight. But if I'm not gonna get what I'm entitled to through, you know, the the agreement that I entered into for living here or owning property here, then I'm gonna have to move forward with some stuff.\n\nSo I think that's about where that's at. And so if you wanted from our end to retain us to send a letter, this is just for the sake of explanation. Our retainer for that is $5,000. You may be aware of how some of this works, but I'm just gonna explain it for the sake of the the consultation is the retainer is not a flat fee. It's just money upfront for us to work with that we put into a trust account.\n\nWe bill from that trust account at an hourly rate. And whenever we're done representing you, that money is then returned to you, whatever's left over. The the retainer itself covers, legal research, drafting the document itself, sending it, and then dealing with any subsequent negotiations. As well as you have kind of the you know, with the letterhead of a law firm on the letter, you have that extra oomph that says, I'm not just threatening to law to sue. I've now spoken to lawyers, and I'm threatening to sue.\n\nIt's it's a little more you know? Because the the letter itself isn't a legally binding document. It's just the threat of a lawsuit. But when you have that that letterhead on there, it gives it a little more oomph. So there's always that and there's the the value in in retaining there.\n\nBut at this point, if you're not wanting to just jump right in, that's probably a good direction to go is to send them some form of letter either from you or from an attorney's office saying, hey.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's what's up. I think that's that's probably your best bet. Yeah. Do you have any other questions right now?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. And I appreciate you clarifying that. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. That that's really helpful. So so I guess we can't I guess, at this point, the first step is really just to issue the letter and then see how they respond. Would you advise that I put in a certain timeline or date to how quickly they respond?\n\nSpeaker 1: It helps. Yeah. I'd I'd give them two weeks or something like that, say fourteen days. Mhmm. You know, fourteen days from when they receive it to to, respond.\n\nAnd then depending on how you send the letter, if you send it via email or if you're gonna send it through, like, actual mail, if you send it through actual mail, I would suggest sending it via certified mail. While that may cost a little extra, you at least get a confirmation of when it was delivered. And so then you do have, like, a day from when they received it because it doesn't matter if they read it. It matters if they receive it. So that is what I would suggest if you do it if you wanna send, like, a physical letter.\n\nBut if you have their email address, then sending the email will be just, you know they'll get it in the same day. So it's not a big deal.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think you helped, clarify. I think what was helpful is you mentioned that as long as the community is in development, they can still retain, I guess, management of the HOA.\n\nRight?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think to some extent, yes. I will I will I mean, since we've got a few minutes, I'll double check that just to make sure I'm not\n\nSpeaker 0: If you could, I really appreciate it because that's an important issue. Because they can drag that out because they they own the lot to building. So there's no deadline for them to deliver on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Let's see what we can find on that one. Because I don't know to what point, at least I don't know off my at the top of my head at what point they actually have to kind of relinquish control. And, of course, my computer is deciding to give me\n\nSpeaker 0: trouble.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see. So there are about there are three general situations in which the like, a developer can retain control or, like, when they lose control, I guess, over a homeowners association. So it's usually whichever the earlier of the there I I guess there's two and then the third is sort of an extra. So typically, it ends at the earlier of when the developer no longer owns any lots or development rights or seven years after the developer stops offering lots for sale in the ordinary course of business. That way, there's sort of an objective timeline that keeps them from, you know, just hanging on to things forever and indefinitely.\n\nAnd then it also says that the third option is that a a developer can just voluntarily surrender control early. Mhmm. But that's totally voluntary. It's not required. But there's at least those those grounds to know that there is some kind of a an objective line where they have to stop.\n\nSo Mhmm. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So if they own well, they they would own when the building's completed, they would own with private individuals or their own LLC versus of the developer when they build the last two. And then seven years after they no longer offer lots for sale. So that we're only two years in. And, you know, and then you said they can voluntarily relinquish control.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. But there is also the potential of with those lots that they may be getting for themselves, is it in the name of the development company, or is it in the name of the individuals later? You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. When they I think when they assume ownership of each building themselves, my my my speculation is that they're gonna put in the name of their own LLCs.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And so that would take it out of the developer's control in the sense of the development company. So\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah. That way it wouldn't be and then even if they did keep it though, if they're owning it and they're not, you know, then they have that seven year thing still. So would they would at least put a stop on that. But but I would assume that they would relinquish control after that point, but I obviously can't guarantee that. But any other questions?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. I think we've answered all of it, and it looks like we just have six minutes left. But I think it's so far I can't think of anything else. Is there anything that you'd like to share with me that you think is important that I know in this situation?\n\nWe will try to resolve it amicably, and then if not, then if they don't respond, then we will take it to the next step.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Like I said, I think I think you've kind of one, you've already got the right mentality, but two, I think I've already said it is just make sure that you don't don't get aggressive unless it's more in in defense just because that can make things, more difficult. If I I don't there's there's nothing that I can see that they would do to come at you in this way. But if they send you some kind of legal document like a complaint or something, you know, where it might look like they're suing you, talk to a lawyer the very first day you get it. I expect that you would have any way.\n\nI'm just trying to think of anything anything right now that might be helpful. Always make sure to make your payments even if you think that they are being ridiculous because the moment that you stop making payments, you are breaching the contract. So you're, like, breaching the the the CC and Rs. And so if you don't make payments and you breach the contract, you lose your remedies. So always make sure that you're making payments.\n\nSpeaker 0: They have so much control. They collect all our rents, and they take that money out first. And then we get the rest of it after they deduct all the expenses. Their their management fee of 8% on each rental of each all the rent selected plus all the HOA dues. So we don't even have access to that money until they get their share.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow. Well Mhmm. That's crazy. Well, I guess the Here's\n\nSpeaker 0: my thing is to be here's my question too. One last question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let's\n\nSpeaker 0: just say they provide me an accounting. I don't really know what those numbers how do I verify that those numbers are legit? Do I hire a forensic accounting firm to dig a little deeper? How do we go about doing that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you could. To an extent, there's a lot of relying in good faith on people. Mhmm. But, basically, at this point, if if the CC and Rs say this money is being pulled for this reason, right, and that reason doesn't even exist, I e, the pool and all that stuff, where is the money going? If they say, oh, it's going to the pool.\n\nWell, you go, no. It's not. That's that's not true. I don't see a pool. So where is it going?\n\nSo if it if they say it's going to the pool, then that's a problem. If they say it's going somewhere else, then you need to be like, well, I think that's a problem as well. Explain to me why it's not. And that's the other thing too. Don't try to prove why they're doing something wrong.\n\nJust ask them, you know, be like, oh, okay. Well, explain that to me a little bit. You know? It it doesn't have to say, hey. That seems wrong.\n\nTell me what you're doing. Just say, I don't understand. Can you explain that to me a little bit? And see if they'll start to kinda try and tell you and explain. Because if they start to fumble over their words and not understand like, they can't really come up with a solid story as to where things are going, then it sounds like something might be a little, hinky and you need to probably proceed with some kind of action.\n\nOr they may have a good explanation.\n\nSpeaker 0: One yeah. One more question. Are HOA dues supposed to be kept in a trust fund and not commingle with anything else? Right? And no one is supposed to get a dip into it for personal use?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not supposed to dip into it for personal use, but I don't know to what extent that works with developers. I'm sure there's still a rec like, some level of a requirement of separating those funds because they're in a fiduciary role. And so if they are dipping into that and they shouldn't be, that would very much so be a breach of fiduciary duty. But I can't say for certain with a development to what extent it's required to be separate, but I'm pretty certain that it needs to be still. So\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, you've been so helpful. Thank you so much, Caleb.\n\nI really appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You're more than welcome. And then, of course, if you need anything else, like, personally, I hope you don't need to deal with, you know, lawyers and stuff to get things done. But if you do, we're more than happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. You take care, and have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 0: You too. You too. Take care now. Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You as well. Bye.\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "# Consult w/ Angelo Vasquez\nWhittington Kinley, an attorney from Hepworth Legal, consults with Angelo Vasquez regarding a deeding issue on Angelo's property in West Valley City. Angelo wants to remove his ex-partner's name from the deed, as she hasn't contributed financially for years. Whittington explains the process, including the possibility of a contested issue if she refuses to sign a quit claim deed. They discuss the potential need for a demand letter and litigation if she resists. Angelo agrees to proceed, and Whittington outlines the next steps, including compiling necessary documents and drafting a retainer agreement.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/W9EzwBkeLMvnIbCckLc6tZsAk5c?view=transcript>\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Compile financial statements, mortgage documents, and any communications with Trina to support Angelo's case.\n- [ ] Send a demand letter to Trina requesting that she relinquish her interest in the property.\n- [ ] If Trina does not cooperate, proceed with litigation to have her removed from the deed.\n- [ ] Sign a retainer agreement with Hepworth Legal and provide a $5,000 upfront payment to cover the initial legal work.\n## Outline\n### Introduction and Establishing Attorney-Client Privilege\n- Whittington Kinley introduces himself as an attorney with Hepworth Legal and establishes attorney-client privilege.\n- He mentions that any information shared will not leave the office unless there is a risk of serious bodily harm.\n- Whittington Kinley reviews the client information intake form and confirms it is a deeding issue.\n- The client, Angelo, confirms the issue is related to a home in West Valley City where someone's name is on the deed but not the mortgage.\n### Overview of the Deeding Issue\n- Angelo explains that he refinanced the mortgage during COVID, putting his name on it, but the other person's name remains on the deed.\n- He mentions that the other person abandoned their obligations, and he has been paying the mortgage alone.\n- Whittington Kinley inquires about the timeline and confirms that the other person has been out of the picture for about two years.\n- Angelo confirms that he is not in contact with the other person due to ongoing civil matters, including domestic violence.\n### Potential Challenges and Legal Process\n- Whittington Kinley explains the process of transferring a name off a deed using a quit claim deed.\n- He mentions that if the other person contests the removal, it could become a more complex issue.\n- Angelo confirms that the other person has previously indicated unwillingness to remove their name.\n- Whittington Kinley outlines the potential need for a demand letter and the possibility of litigation if the other person contests.\n### Reviewing Property Records and Legal Strategy\n- Whittington Kinley checks the Salt Lake County Recorders website and confirms that the other person's name is still on the property.\n- He explains that if the other person contests, it will require more legal effort, including possibly going to court.\n- Whittington Kinley suggests compiling financial statements and other relevant documents to support the case.\n- He outlines the process of sending a demand letter and the potential need for a retainer agreement if litigation is necessary.\n### Retainer Agreement and Cost Estimation\n- Whittington Kinley explains the retainer agreement process, including the initial upfront payment and hourly billing.\n- He estimates that the initial retainer agreement would cover reviewing documents, formulating a legal strategy, and sending a demand letter.\n- Angelo inquires about the typical outcome of such cases and the potential cost of litigation.\n- Whittington Kinley explains that the cost depends on the other person's actions and the complexity of the case.\n### Next Steps and Client Information\n- Whittington Kinley asks Angelo to take time to review the information and decide on retaining the firm.\n- He confirms Angelo's contact information and prepares to send the retainer agreement and other necessary documents.\n- Angelo agrees to take the information and decide on the next steps.\n- Whittington Kinley confirms that all necessary information will be emailed to Angelo and that the retainer agreement will be digital.\n\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Had a baby in 2021 and didn't go back to work immediately. Prior to leave, was training for general manager position. Was supposed to go back into that position after returning from FMLA and maternity leave. While away, the owners sold the company. Started workng with the new owners, who promised a position that would have been a promotion. When went back to work, someone else was in the job, a male who had been below Mikali prior. Put her into office manager position, which was a demotion from what she had been promised. But they also gave her a raise, so they said it wasn't a demotion. Mikali questioned the decision and was told, \"Well, since you have a new baby, we thought you wouldn't be able to handle the general manager position.\"\n\nJennie asked for the date on which that comment was made. It was January of 2023. The statute of limitation therefore ran in June of 2023. Jennie explained that there is no way to get around the statute of limitation, and this case is DOA. But Jennie used nicer words and assured Mikali that she had not been \"stupid\" to delay discussing the issue with an attorney.\n\nMikali asked if she could have a partial refund since there was nothing else to talk about during the hour-long consultation she had scheduled. Jennie said sure thing.\n",

Case # 012300887 Here is a summary of the key points from the conversation: - The conversation was between attorney Michael Hepworth, Thomas (the 17-year old client), Thomas's mother Melanie, and Thomas's father Pope.  - Thomas is facing criminal charges - DUI, possession of marijuana, and refusing a chemical test. He also refused a warrant to draw blood, so there is no blood test evidence. - Thomas recently experienced serious mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts, and was hospitalized and on medication but stopped taking it.  - On the day he got in trouble, Thomas was having delusions and hallucinations, believing he was seeing and hearing divine/religious things. He was not in his right mind. - His mother believes Thomas was incompetent to consent or not consent to the blood draw due to his diminished mental state. The attorney agrees this could support a challenge based on incompetence. - The goal is to get Thomas treatment for his mental health issues. The attorney will enter his appearance, notify the court he is representing Thomas, and work to invoke a competency hearing. - The attorney will send a retainer agreement to represent Thomas. The parents will sign and pay the $4,000 retainer fee.  - The attorney will get evidence from the prosecution, speak to Thomas privately, and build their legal strategy. - Thomas wants to return to Salt Lake City to continue school while this case proceeds, but his parents currently have custody and want him in St. George. The attorney will help them work through this issue. - Overall, the focus is getting Thomas the mental health treatment he needs and resolving the criminal charges through an incompetence claim or other strategies.\n",

        "Transcript Paragraphs Transcript": "\nSpeaker 0: Hi. Good morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm good. How about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Good to hear. So before we get into it, let me just get through some preliminary stuff. First of all, we record all these conversations. Part of that is quality control. Part of it is I have software that helps take notes.\n\nAll that being said, everything we talk about is covered under attorney client privilege. That includes the recording and includes the notes. Any questions about any of that? Nope. K.\n\nI think that's the fastest I've spit all of that out. Mhmm. Okay. So, I I'm I'm looking at your notes and the the stuff you sent over. I kinda look through the videos right before we jumped on here.\n\nAnd then I went and jumped on Instagram and looked at this profile. So I have a basic idea of what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: But, one, I don't know anything about the ins and outs of picking a wedding dress. And two, I don't really know how the, how the logistics work. So why don't you just kind of take it from the top, from, when, Abby, is that her name? Abby came into your store and and kinda go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, when she booked her appointment, I took the appointment personally. So, we ended up liking two different dresses, and she liked the aspect of one dress, which had this folded piece of fabric. And the dress that she tried on that she really loved the shape of, it had a more draped neckline off the shoulder. She didn't want it off the shoulder.\n\nShe didn't want the draping, and she wanted to have pockets in it. So, essentially, with that designer, we can do micro changes like that. So we were just going to take the fold off of one dress and put it on the other. Really simple. Typically, if it's something I can't do, I would never offer it.\n\nSo it was a very simple fix for the designer to do. When they place the order with us, they do sign a contract signing off on the custom. They understand what the custom is. We make it very clear, almost dumb it down to a kindergarten level so that it's just, easy for people to understand. And then, when her gown arrived, we do a quality control check on it.\n\nEverything checked out. It's everything that we discussed. And from there, we got the email. Found out that she was kind of concerned about the coloring. Well, the sun shines at different times throughout the day in the store.\n\nSo she originally had a photo on one side of the store with the sun shining in. She took another photo on the other area of the store at another time of day where it wasn't. So, you know, we kind of addressed that. Dresses have this fabric underneath called crinoline. It gives it fullness.\n\nWhen we freshly steam a dress that has arrived, it kinda fluffs it up a little bit more. So we addressed that concern. Nothing was ever about the custom being wrong or anything like that. So when I saw this video, I was kind of a little bit shocked because we did nothing wrong. Everything was as we discussed.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am also the type of person who and I've run this store. It's my store for six years. If there's ever a problem, I fix it with the bride. It's their wedding day. I have integrity.\n\nI would never let anybody be unhappy whether it was my fault or not. So I I I'm just kind of shocked, about the outcome. So I I want to have the videos taken down as soon as possible.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Let's start here because I I watched the video, and maybe I'm missing, like, a a tag or something in the caption or something like that. But does she mention where she got the dress, all that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: She has not yet, but the photos are in our store, and she is alluding to it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Talk to me more about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: In several of the comments, they've mentioned that there would be a part two coming or, that they, you know, are gonna go into further detail about it. I think also in our industry, I mean, our our you you know what store they're in. There's not that many bridal stores in the area. So the photos I mean, it I looked at several comments where brides know that it was our store. Our designers reached out and sent me the video having no idea what was going on, but they recognized our store.\n\nI'll be\n\nSpeaker 0: Tell okay. So your your designers sent you sent you like, that's how you became aware of the video?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. One of my designers, it came up on her TikTok feed, and she sent it to me. That's how I first found out about it. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I looked at it on Instagram. I don't use TikTok. I don't have TikTok, so I don't know. But, like, what what kind of of reach are we talking about on on TikTok? Because Instagram, it looked like it looked like it was pretty, you know, it was it's certainly more interaction than I've ever gotten on there, but I don't know that that I don't know that bar is super high.\n\nIt it looked like a good bit, but, like, it doesn't look like she's doesn't look like her account is verified or anything. It's not like you know, it's not it's not the biggest post on the Internet at least. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out, like, like, where we fall on, on on the virality of\n\nSpeaker 1: it. Sorry. I'm just pulling it up.\n\nSpeaker 0: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the video on TikTok has about close to 75,000 views, and then it has about 6,500 likes, a 144 shares, and a 143 bookmarks, and then there's 88 comments.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. Alright. So now let's, let's I'm gonna go through a little bit of a spiel that I go through on every kind of potential defamation case that that I do a consultation for. So when it comes to defamation, there are really, it's five elements.\n\nBut for this case, I'm gonna drop one of those. So we're gonna talk about four elements that you have to prove. So first of all, the first thing you have to show is you have to show that whatever the defamatory that that there is a defamatory statement made and that it is false. Right? So that's the first thing.\n\nWhenever I do these consults, I take everything you tell me at your word. Right? So I don't have any reason to to believe that anything you're telling me isn't accurate, so I'm gonna go ahead and check that box. Right? K.\n\nThe second thing that you have to, show is you have to show that it's been published. With social media, that's easy. It's public. It's published. I don't follow this person, and I've and I've found her account and could see everything on it.\n\nSo publication, check. The third thing you have to post or the third thing you have to meet is you have to meet the element of, intent. There has to be either some kind of malicious or negligent intent. Most cases fall under negligent. Right?\n\nMost of the time, people aren't doing this. I mean, sometimes they do, but most of the time, it's not, I wanna hurt this person. I'm gonna do this. This to me looks like content. Right?\n\nThis just looks like she found a a good angle for some content and your collateral damage. Right? So we'll so we'll check the box for negligence because I think that, you know, it's pretty easy to to come to the conclusion that you could hurt somebody's business by doing that. The last thing is damages. This one is gonna be the big question for your situation right now.\n\nRight? This was posted when was this posted?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hers on Instagram was posted, I think, on Sunday, and then this TikTok, I think, was posted just yesterday. Okay. The day before. Three days ago. Yeah.\n\nSo I guess they all posted it on Sunday.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So, so then with the damages element, aside from designers you work with reaching out and saying, hey. You should probably see this, has there have you seen any kind of impact? Like, has anybody brought it up to you? Have you had appointments canceled?\n\nOr what anything like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've read some of the comments, and I've seen some of our brides who are in the comments. And this just got posted. So\n\nSpeaker 0: When you say some of your brides, do you mean current, future?\n\nSpeaker 1: Current. I mean, it could be future, but current brides who have purchased a dress from us, like, I saw one comment who said, oh, I purchased my dress from there. Now I'm nervous.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Okay. It's\n\nSpeaker 0: Has that person reached out or said anything to you directly? No. Okay. Okay. So, so where you are right now and I'm not saying there isn't anything you can do right now.\n\nI'm just I'm just starting at potential litigation and working our way back. Right? Sorry. You froze. Are you still with me?\n\nOh, there you go. Yes. Okay. Okay. So so where you are right now is I don't think you have a currently actionable defamation case because I don't think you have current provable damages.\n\nAnd I don't and I think that there might be an argument there to say that future damages are there's an argument that you could make to say that future damages are inevitable here, but I don't think that there's quite enough there there yet to to even get over that hurdle. So so I don't think there's anything actionable\n\nSpeaker 1: Now Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: That doesn't mean there's nothing you could do, because a lot of the time with cases like this, a cease and desist letter does the trick. A A cease and desist letter is exactly what it sounds right like, you've seen it on TV, you've heard about it, whatever. It is you know, it's it's pretty it's pretty self explanatory, but, basically, it comes on a law firm's letterhead. It's signed by an attorney. It cites statute.\n\nIt cites causes of action that could be brought in a lawsuit, all that kind of stuff. Mhmm. And a lot of the time, people get freaked out by them. They don't wanna deal with it. They don't wanna hire lawyers.\n\nThey don't wanna go to court. And so they just do whatever you're asking them to do. They back off. Right. Now this is all very speculative, and maybe I'm doing a little bit of stereotyping here.\n\nBut, you know, I'm looking through her profile. She doesn't seem to be hurting for money. Right? So a lot of the times, the cease and desist letters, the biggest thing is, oh, I don't wanna hire an attorney. I don't wanna you know, litigating and defending myself in court and all that kind of stuff is expensive.\n\nI don't think that that is going to be the angle that scares her off here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: So it is a little bit more of a risk to just take a shot with a demand letter or a cease and desist letter than it than it normally is with these cases. Now that being said, it's, you know, it is for you, it's about peace of mind at this point. Right? Mhmm. And so if if you think that that sending that letter and and you know?\n\nWell, if sending that letter and and it works, right, then you've got your peace of mind. You, you know, you can you can rest easy, you know, and she took down the promise, and you don't have to worry about it. If it doesn't work, then you're in, you know, you're in a situation where you have made a threat, and your bluff has been called. And right now, it is just a bluff. Because right now, you don't have a case that could be brought in court, really.\n\nI mean, you could bring the case. You could try, but it would get dismissed pretty quickly without damages. So, so it it it there has to be you know, you have to think about the risk reward calculus here. Mhmm. And and to help you a little bit with that, I'll go ahead and go through kind of what you're looking at logistically from from our from, you know, getting us involved.\n\nSo, first of all, we do everything here by retainer. For a cease and desist sutter, we usually do our minimum retainer. It's $5,000 retainer. If you ever worked by retainer before, basically, it's you give us a chunk of money upfront. We bill our hourly against it.\n\nAnd then we, you know, if there's anything left over at the end, you get that back. If there's not, then, you know, you don't. And if it goes further, if it goes into litigation or something like that, we would need to set for a separate retainer. If there's anything left over in the the cease and desist letter retainer and you're going to litigation, you can move those funds over. Right.\n\nRight. So that's that's logistically how it works. Typically, just to give you an idea, my hourly rate is $3.25. I'm on the lower end of the spectrum for attorneys here as far as pricing. There are some that are around $4.25, some that are 300, and that's kind of the range for attorneys.\n\nFor me, on letters like this, it is typically between three and seven hours worth of work to sit down, get all the documents together, do the research on causes of action, pen to paper, letters out the door. That time frame tends to be based on how complicated the situation is. This one's pretty straightforward. So, you know, you're probably talking about five hours of of work, roughly. Right?\n\nIt's always an estimate. So you're looking at a little over a thousand dollars for the letter to get out the door. And if it works, then great. You've, you know, you you spend a thousand bucks, but you saved yourself a bunch of heartache. You saved yourself maybe some, a significant amount more in losses.\n\nSo great. If it doesn't work, then you're gonna have to go into litigation. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not concerned about that. I have actually had this situation happen, like, four years ago with another influencer. The cease and desist letter shut it down immediately. So I feel like that might just be what I need to do is just send\n\nSpeaker 0: it to\n\nSpeaker 1: both of those girls, because I mean, even with her wedding dress, it's like she she didn't spend $10,000 on a on a dress. So, yeah, she may have a family that's affluent, but I don't think, a fresh new marriage that she's ready to go up to bat against a business.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sure. I suppose I shouldn't I shouldn't, jump to that conclusion with influencers because you'd never really know. But, but, I I that that reminds me, I wanted to also address because we've been talking about Abby this whole time, but you also listed as an opposing party, Kiana Giddings?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. She's the one who posted it to TikTok. That's how\n\nSpeaker 0: the\n\nSpeaker 1: one that I originally saw. And then I went to Abby's Instagram. Okay. I'm not sure if it's on Kiana's Instagram. I honestly haven't even looked yet.\n\nI haven't looked at, Abby's TikTok to see if she has one, but that's just kinda where I saw it, and I'm trying to, like, nip it in the bud. Okay. So there isn't a part two. It doesn't go any further because I in a sense, this is just clout chasing after I've read through some of the comments. I think she's trying to propel herself to be like, I'm a designer.\n\nI'm gonna start designing wedding dresses from this experience. So that I'm I'm kind of trying to see it from all angles, and that's one of them that's kinda standing out to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you've done this before and the and the cease and desist letter, worked, then I can I can get behind that confidence? So okay.\n\nSo, so like I said, it's usually pretty quick for us, as long as, you know, whatever it's and I I should say it will likely be me because you're consulting with me. My case load is pretty full, so that might be a conversation. If it's not me, all of our attorneys do these kinds of, Okay. Cease and desist letters all the time. So, so, you know, once you sign one one once you're you're working on signing the retainer, we can, you know, we can figure that out.\n\nBut no matter who it is, you know, as long as the calendar is pretty clear, it's quick to get these written and and sent out the door. So we can we can definitely, impart some urgency here. The way it works for us, if you decide you wanna go with us and you wanna hire us to do a cease and desist letter, we just put all your information into into your consult notes. A link gets sent to your email. It looks like you gave us an info at the bridal studio utah dot com.\n\nIs that a good you check that email address and everything? Yes. Okay. So the, the link will go to that. That'll be a link to sign the actual retainer agreement Sometimes it takes about twenty four hours for our system to catch up, but most of the time it happens pretty quick.\n\nRight. And once once your matter is created, we can get started. So k. Do you have any other questions or anything else specific you wanted to address here? I just wanna make sure you get through everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I don't think so. I think you answered everything pretty clearly. In terms of, you know, if we wanted to get that started right away, what is the turnaround time for the cease and desist letter?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I have presumed to this point that you have her contact information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: I you shipped her you shipped her address, so I assume you have her address and and phone number, email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have her address, but I do have her phone number, email. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. As long as we have contact information that we can we can get this to her pretty quickly. We can look up our address if we have phone number and email address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So we can the I mean, really, the turnaround time is once the letter is written, if we're doing it by email, goes out right then. Okay. If we're doing it by certified mail, twenty four or forty eight hours usually. Mhmm. I tend to like to do both just in case because it's gonna be easy to ignore an email.\n\nYep. So that's probably how we would go about it. Mhmm. One other thing I guess we should note, and although you said you've done this before with an influencer, so maybe you've already thought about this. Maybe it's not a concern for you, but I do just need to do my diligence here.\n\nAbsolutely. There is always the risk that they get a cease and desist letter. They get something from an attorney, and they go, oh, you wanna do that. Well, then I'm gonna make a video about this, and we're gonna post about how. And then, you know, you might have to deal with some blowback there.\n\nPersonally, I think that somebody exercising their rights is not a problem. So I don't, you know, I don't know that it's that big risk, but it is a concern for some people. So I wanna be sure that you thought about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: But, again, you've been through this before. So if it didn't happen, then might not be that big a concern.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, it's just a young girl who's just trying to get just clout chasing. I I mean, if if I truly had done something wrong, I would've fixed the problem. But it we didn't. So, I just I'm feeling like I'm being targeted for something that never happened.\n\nYeah. So I I I don't I don't see her doing that. I I feel like if I were that age and that had happened to me, I would shut my mouth.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Sure. Me too. Okay. Well, I will put all your info into the system.\n\nKeep an eye on your email. You should get a link pretty quickly. And, like I said, you're not under any obligation to to sign any of that stuff. So if you're still shopping around for attorneys, that's fine. Once you're ready, though, just go ahead, sign that retainer agreement, make payment, and we'll get moving.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No problem. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll be in touch.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 0: Kylie, we can close. +1, 23456789.\n",

He methodically explained the four elements of defamation, assessed the current situation's legal standing, and provided clear options with transparent pricing.\n\nThe attorney demonstrated strong legal expertise by systematically breaking down defamation requirements: \"When it comes to defamation, there are really...four elements that you have to prove.\" He effectively explained why litigation might be premature while offering a practical alternative: \"A cease and desist letter does the trick.\" His pricing transparency was excellent: \"For a cease and desist letter, we usually do our minimum retainer. It's $5,000.\"\n\nThe consultation's turning point came when the client revealed prior success with cease and desist letters: \"I have actually had this situation happen...The cease and desist letter shut it down immediately.\" This disclosure allowed the attorney to pivot from cautious assessment to confident solution-offering.\n\nAreas for improvement include deeper emotional connection with the client's business concerns and stronger urgency creation. When the client expressed feeling targeted (\"I'm feeling like I'm being targeted for something that never happened\"), the attorney missed an opportunity to validate these emotions before proceeding to logistics.\n\nThe attorney effectively closed by clearly outlining next steps: \"Keep an eye on your email. You should get a link pretty quickly,\" while maintaining appropriate boundaries by emphasizing no obligation: \"You're not under any obligation to sign any of that stuff.\""

        "Consult Transcript (Claude)": "Based on the dialogue content and context, I can identify:\nSpeaker 0 is Attorney Ryan Nelson\nSpeaker 1 is Client Bridget Geyer\n\n# Consultation Summary\n\n## Overview\nThe consultation focused on potential legal action regarding defamatory social media content posted about Bridget Geyer's bridal studio. A customer (Abby) and an influencer (Kiana Giddings) posted content on TikTok and Instagram suggesting issues with a wedding dress customization, despite the business fulfilling the order as specified. The content has gained significant social media traction with approximately 75,000 views on TikTok.\n\n## Action Items\n- Attorney to prepare cease and desist letters for both Abby and Kiana Giddings\n- Client to provide contact information (phone, email, address) for both parties\n- Client to review and sign retainer agreement (to be sent via email)\n- Client to submit $5,000 retainer payment upon agreement\n\n## Insights\n- Current situation does not meet full criteria for actionable defamation case due to lack of provable damages\n- Four key elements discussed for defamation:\n1. False defamatory statement (confirmed)\n2. Publication (confirmed via social media)\n3. Intent/negligence (confirmed)\n4. Damages (currently insufficient evidence)\n- Client has previous successful experience with cease and desist resolution in similar situation\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Attorney's office to send retainer agreement to info@thebridalstudioutah.com\n2. Client to review and sign retainer agreement\n3. Upon retainer payment, attorney to draft cease and desist letters\n4. Letters to be sent via both email and certified mail\n\n## Questions Discussed\n- Current reach and impact of social media posts\n- Existence of provable damages\n- Process and cost of cease and desist letters\n- Timeline for letter preparation and delivery\n- Potential risks of escalation through additional social media posts\n\n## Timeline\n- Original posts made on Sunday\n- TikTok video posted three days prior to consultation\n- Estimated 3-7 hours of attorney work for letter preparation\n- 24-48 hour delivery timeline for certified mail\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile current circumstances don't support immediate litigation, a cease and desist letter approach is recommended as the initial step. Attorney fees are estimated at $325/hour, with total cost likely around $1,000 for letter preparation. The client's previous success with cease and desist letters in similar situations suggests this may be an effective approach to resolve the issue promptly.\n",

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Here's a comprehensive report on the conversation:\n\nKey Participants:\n1\\. Michael Hepworth - Attorney\n2\\. Debra Shannon - Homeowner\n3\\. Sara Wimmer - Homeowner\n\nSituation Overview:\nTwo homeowners, Debra Shannon and Sara Wimmer, are experiencing water damage in their basement units of a condominium complex. The issue arose on August 9-11, 2024, when sprinklers in the neighboring property (Clover Creek apartments) were left on for an extended period. The homeowners' association (HOA) maintenance person, Tom, turned off something related to the sprinkler system on August 11.\n\nKey Issues:\n1\\. Water Damage: Both homeowners have water damage in their basements, including mold growth behind drywall.\n2\\. Foundation Cracks: Debra's unit has foundation cracks, while Sara's does not.\n3\\. Responsibility Dispute: The HOA (represented by Lance) claims they are not responsible for the outside sprinklers or the resulting damage.\n4\\. Insurance Claims: The homeowners are in the process of filing insurance claims with Farmers Insurance.\n\nLegal Considerations:\n1\\. Common Area Responsibility: Attorney Hepworth believes the HOA is likely responsible for common areas, including external plumbing and foundational issues.\n2\\. Limited Common Areas: While some areas may be designated as \"limited common areas\" under HOA bylaws, the sprinkler system in question is likely not included in this category.\n3\\. Insurance Claims: The attorney advises filing claims with personal insurance, which may then pursue the HOA's insurance if appropriate.\n\nExpert Opinions:\n1\\. Sprinkler Issue vs. Pipe Break: Hepworth suggests that the damage is more likely due to a broken pipe rather than just sprinklers being left on, based on the extent of flooding.\n2\\. Foundation Repair: The attorney questions the necessity and effectiveness of proposed interior fixes (like French drains) and suggests that proper repair may require excavation and external sealing.\n\nRecommended Actions:\n1\\. Meet with HOA: Arrange a meeting with Lance (HOA representative), maintenance personnel, and potentially contractors to inspect the damage and identify the source.\n2\\. Challenge Denials: If the HOA continues to deny responsibility, request contact information for the HOA's attorney.\n3\\. Insurance Claims: Proceed with filing claims with personal insurance (Farmers) for both homeowners.\n4\\. Additional Inspections: Seek a second opinion on the foundation issues and proposed repairs.\n5\\. Document Everything: Keep detailed records of all communications, inspections, and repair estimates.\n\nLegal Strategy:\nHepworth advises attempting to resolve the issue without immediate legal action. However, he is prepared to intervene if the HOA remains uncooperative. The estimated cost for legal representation would be between $2,500 and $4,000, with an initial retainer of $5,000 if formal legal action becomes necessary.\n\nNext Steps:\n1\\. Homeowners to arrange a meeting with HOA representatives and inspect the property together.\n2\\. File insurance claims with Farmers Insurance.\n3\\. Obtain additional expert opinions on foundation repair.\n4\\. Keep the attorney informed of progress and any further denials from the HOA.\n\nThe situation remains unresolved, but there is a clear path forward for the homeowners to pursue resolution through their HOA and personal insurance before escalating to legal action.\n\n**Here's an analysis of the HOA's potential liability:**\n\n1\\. Common Area Responsibility: \n  Attorney Hepworth strongly suggests that the water line in question is part of the common area, which falls under HOA responsibility. He states: \"The law is they have to, they have to fix the building outside. Everything outside you're responsible for the interior walls inside, right?\"\n\n2\\. Cause of Damage:\n  If the water damage originated from a common area (i.e., the broken water line outside), the HOA would be responsible for damages caused by this failure. Hepworth notes: \"But if the damage came from the outside in, they're the legal cause of the harm.\"\n\n3\\. Limited Control by Homeowners:\n  The attorney emphasizes that homeowners have no control over main water lines, stating: \"This is one of those issues. It's a main line that you have you cannot control, that they won't let you control.\" This lack of homeowner control strongly implies HOA responsibility.\n\n4\\. Insurance Claim Liability:\n  Hepworth suggests that even if the homeowners file claims with their personal insurance, those insurance companies may pursue the HOA's insurance for reimbursement, indicating the HOA's underlying liability.\n\n5\\. Foundation Issues:\n  If the water line break caused or exacerbated foundation problems, the HOA might be liable for these repairs as well. Hepworth states: \"You can't repair the foundation by yourself, because that's not even your property. Technically, that's yours, yours. Everybody's in the community is those common walls.\"\n\n6\\. Potential for Special Assessment:\n  The attorney mentions that if significant repairs are needed, especially for foundation issues, the HOA might need to do a special assessment on all units. This suggests the HOA acknowledges some level of liability for major structural repairs resulting from the water line break.\n\n7\\. Previous Incidents:\n  The mention of a previous flooding issue with another unit in the complex (which resulted in small claims court action) might establish a pattern of HOA responsibility for similar issues.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the attorney's analysis, the HOA likely has substantial liability for repairs related to the water line breaking, particularly for damage originating from common areas and affecting the structure's integrity. The HOA would likely be responsible for repairing the broken water line itself and may be liable for resultant damages to individual units, especially if the damage can be directly attributed to the failure of common area infrastructure.\n",

        "Clio Matter Details": "\nMet with Debra Shannon & Sara Wimmer who are neighbors in this condo complex.\n\n\nflood damage from condo sprinkler system - complex next door sprinklers' overflowed & hers+neighbours basement flooded 11 Aug - HOA is saying they're responsible for the outside sprinklers instead of HOA's ins as in CC&Rs - neighbour Sarah Wimmer will be joining via phone (801) 995-5388\n\nFrom Sara Wimmer:\n\"On Friday August 9th, 2024 in the evening, I noticed that the small patch of grass up the hill from me had the sprinkler on all day. This is owned by Clover Creek Apartments. Then on Saturday they were still on. I did not know who to call but on Sunday they were off. I am not sure who told them about the sprinklers.\n\nOn Sunday Tom the maintenance man for our HOA (Glendon Way Condominiums) knocked on my door and asked if I had water in my basement since Debra had water in hers. I went downstairs and d found I had water coming in to my basement. I went back outside and told Tom and Debra I too had water in my basement. Tom was doing something with our sprinklers system it looked like he turned something off but I am not sure. Tom said someone would come out tomorrow (Monday) and repair our sprinkler system. After which I went back inside to clean up as much water as I could. On Monday, I called All Pro to come out and dry out the wall and prevent mold growth. All Pro came out on Thursday and found 3 walls were still reading damp. I then hired them. I will attach their estimate for just the clean up. Once they pulled out the dry wall, there was more mold growth than what would have been for one leak to cause. But I could not see any cracks in my foundation. So when Debra said she was having someone come look at her foundation I had them look at mine and he saw no cracks in my foundations. \"\n\n--\nNew  Matter:\nBasement flood due to leaving sprinkler system on.\n\nanswer: HOA dispute matter\nquestion: Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting.\n\nanswer: Glendon Way HOA - Clover Creek Apartments\nquestion: We need to clear any potential conflicts of interest.

Consultation Overview\nThe consultation began with a clear explanation of attorney-client privilege, establishing initial comfort. The flow was structured, addressing landlord-tenant issues, but moments of client disengagement occurred when complex legal concepts were not fully clarified.\n\n2. Attorney Performance Analysis\n- Expertise Demonstration: Kinley effectively explained the eviction process, stating, \"Typically in civil matters... you have three weeks to respond.\" However, some legal jargon may have confused the client.\n- Sales Technique Evaluation: Rapport was built through active listening, but objection handling was weak. When discussing retainer fees, Kinley could have better addressed Ochu's concerns about costs.\n- Professional Presence Assessment: Kinley displayed confidence and empathy, but time management could improve, as the conversation occasionally drifted.\n\n3. Critical Moments Analysis\nKey decision points included Ochu's hesitation about the retainer fee. A missed opportunity arose when Kinley did not effectively address Ochu's concerns about potential credit impacts from the eviction process.\n\n4. Retention Analysis\nOchu's non-retention stemmed from unclear next steps and pricing concerns. The value proposition was not sufficiently articulated, leading to hesitation in commitment.\n\n5. Improvement Recommendations\n- Enhance clarity in explaining legal concepts to avoid client confusion.\n- Strengthen objection handling techniques, particularly regarding pricing.\n- Establish clearer next steps to guide clients post-consultation.\n\n6. Comparative Analysis\nKinley's performance was strong in legal knowledge but fell short in sales techniques compared to best practices, which emphasize clear communication and effective objection handling.\n\nOverall, while the consultation demonstrated solid legal expertise, improvements in communication and sales techniques could enhance client retention and satisfaction."

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "Executive Summary:\nThis transcript documents a consultation between attorneys Michael Hepworth and Trevor Stevens, and their client Dan Stevens, regarding a complex real estate dispute. The case involves multiple contracts, allegations of incompetence, and potential title issues for a condominium property. The attorneys discussed legal strategy, potential outcomes, and next steps to resolve the dispute.\nKey Points:\n1. Property Background:\n- The dispute centers around a condominium unit originally owned by Morgan Lineback.\n- The property went through foreclosure proceedings and was redeemed by the clients.\n- There are competing claims to the property between the clients and another party (Antonio Padilla).\n1. Legal Issues:\n- Multiple contracts and assignments were executed for the property, creating ambiguity.\n- Questions about the validity of a power of attorney used in transactions.\n- Concerns about the mental competence of the original property owner (Morgan).\n- Competing claims between the clients and Padilla regarding who has valid title/contract rights.\n1. Client Actions:\n- The clients paid approximately $43,000 to redeem the property from foreclosure.\n- They have invested additional funds in property repairs and maintenance.\n- Multiple contracts and assignments were executed in attempts to secure their interest.\n1. Legal Strategy:\n- Focus on establishing that the clients had equitable title from their original contract in December 2023.\n- Argue that subsequent contracts by Padilla are invalid due to the clients' prior interest.\n- Potentially seek appointment of a guardian/conservator for Morgan due to competency concerns.\n- Consider options for reaching a settlement with the opposing party (Padilla).\n1. Next Steps:\n- Attorney Hepworth to review case documents and contact opposing counsel (Spencer McDonald).\n- Discuss potential settlement options to avoid protracted litigation.\n- If settlement not possible, prepare to litigate ownership claims.\n- Explore options for addressing Morgan's competency and ability to convey title.\n1. Financial Considerations:\n- Initial retainer of $7,500 for legal services.\n- Estimated total legal costs could range from $5,000 to $75,000 depending on complexity.\n- Discussion of potential property value ($200,000-$300,000) versus money invested ($70,000+).\nConclusion:\nThis case presents complex legal issues regarding property ownership, contract validity, and mental competence. The attorneys believe they have a strong claim to the property based on equitable title theories, but recognize challenges in conclusively establishing ownership. They plan to pursue settlement discussions while preparing for potential litigation. Key next steps involve contacting opposing counsel and addressing the original owner's ability to convey clear title.\n",

Key issues include multiple contracts, the validity of a power of attorney, and the mental competence of the original owner, Morgan Lineback. The clients redeemed the property from foreclosure and invested in repairs. The legal strategy focuses on asserting the clients' equitable title from a December 2023 contract and challenging Padilla's claims. Next steps include reviewing documents, contacting opposing counsel, and exploring settlement options, with litigation as a backup. Financial considerations include a $7,500 retainer and potential legal costs of $5,000 to $75,000."

The tenants moved out of a house with pre-existing issues, only to have the owner claim extensive damages and renovate the property, charging them over $20,000. The tenants were unaware of the insurance claims made by the owner before receiving a disposition letter. Ryan suggested drafting a demand letter and possibly mediation, emphasizing the need for documentation, such as the lease and pre-move-in pictures, to support their case. He explained the retainer process and potential costs, including a $4,000 retainer for a demand letter.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/3oJfEGH7JEnGUjjj6KU5YqZuwjY?view=transcript>\n## Action

Minor improvement needed in objection handling.\n\nDetailed Analysis:\n\n1. Consultation Overview\nThe consultation began with a clear establishment of attorney-client privilege, setting a comfortable tone. The flow was structured, with Ryan guiding Joshua through the severance agreement details. Key discussion points included compensation, legal implications of the termination, and the non-disparagement clause. Critical moments included Joshua's concerns about fairness and potential repercussions, which Ryan addressed effectively.\n\n2. Attorney Performance Analysis\n- Expertise Demonstration: Ryan displayed strong legal knowledge, explaining, \"Utah's not well employer, right? So there's not a lot you can do there,\" clarifying the legal landscape for Joshua.\n- Sales Technique Evaluation: Rapport was built through active listening and empathy. Ryan effectively handled objections, stating, \"You could negotiate a severance package,\" while maintaining a supportive tone.\n- Professional Presence Assessment: Ryan exhibited confidence and clarity, managing time well and maintaining professionalism throughout.\n\n3. Critical Moments Analysis\nKey decision points included Joshua's hesitation about the severance package's fairness. Ryan's reassurance, \"This is exceptionally fair,\" helped alleviate concerns. A missed opportunity was not exploring Joshua's feelings about the workplace culture more deeply.\n\n4. Retention Analysis\nFactors leading to retention included clear communication of the value of the severance package and Ryan's empathetic approach. The pricing strategy was effective, as Joshua felt the compensation was fair.\n\n5. Improvement Recommendations\n- Enhance objection handling by preparing for more specific client concerns.\n- Explore deeper emotional cues from clients to strengthen rapport.\n- Consider training on negotiation strategies to empower clients further.\n\n6. Comparative Analysis\nRyan's performance aligns well with best practices in legal consultations, particularly in client engagement and legal clarity. Continued focus on objection handling will further enhance effectiveness."

Speaker 2, an Operations Manager for 17 years, was terminated due to alleged inappropriate behavior with a colleague and previous corrective actions. The severance package includes $68,050, prorated profit sharing, and $10,000 for paid time off. Ryan advises that the package is fair, especially given the non-disparagement clause and the positive reference Speaker 2 will receive. Concerns about the HR manager's behavior are noted, but Ryan advises against using them in negotiations without concrete evidence to avoid extortion claims.\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Review the severance agreement with a California-licensed attorney to ensure Joshua's rights are fully protected.\n- [ ] If Joshua wishes to report any potential misconduct by the HR manager, consult with a California attorney on the appropriate steps to do so without violating the non-disparagement clause.\n- [ ] Sign the severance agreement to finalize the separation and receive the compensation package.\n## Decisions made\n- Joshua was advised to sign the severance agreement.\n- Ryan recommended accepting the severance package, describing it as \"rock solid\".\n## Issues & Risks\n- Joshua

the purpose of recording the conversation for quality control and attorney-client privilege.\n- Ryan Nelson mentions the need to adapt to a changing interface for their system.\n- Ryan Nelson reviews

to cut ties due to multiple incidents, including alcohol-related misjudgments.\n### Clarification on Employment and Termination\n- Ryan Nelson confirms that the employment took place in Utah, despite

employment state, making wrongful termination actions difficult to pursue.\n- Ryan Nelson emphasizes the importance of protecting Speaker 2's rights in the severance agreement.\n### Severance Package Details\n- Ryan Nelson outlines the severance package, including a base amount and prorated profit sharing.\n- Speaker 2 confirms their annual salary and the total severance package offered.\n- Ryan

HOA had ClearCut come out as well and a mold test.  Repairs are upwards of $6,000+ to remediate.  The husband also did contractor work on other basement for a neighbor.

        "Clio Consultation Notes": "# Consult with Katelynn Kuan\nKatelynn Kuan consulted Sarah Spitzer about her ex-husband's non-compliance with their divorce decree, which required him to sell or refinance his home by August. Katelynn had sold her property but her ex-husband had not taken any action. Sarah explained the next steps, including filing a motion to enforce the decree, which could lead to contempt charges if he doesn't comply. They discussed potential turnaround times, with a hearing likely in January or February. Sarah also mentioned the possibility of seeking reimbursement for attorney fees. Katelynn expressed concerns about being seen as confrontational but agreed to consider the options, including a more amicable approach.\n## Transcript\n<https://otter.ai/u/hFUrBy4YH27k9RaitagjYOJpL4M?view=transcript>\n## Action Items\n- [ ] File a motion to enforce the divorce decree with the court.\n- [ ] Provide Katelynn with a summary of the options, including filing a motion to enforce or seeking reimbursement of attorney's fees.\n- [ ] Send Katelynn a retainer agreement if she decides to proceed with legal action.\n- [ ] Reach out to Katelynn's ex-husband to see if he will comply with the decree before filing the motion to enforce.\n## Decisions made\n- Katelynn decided to think over her options before proceeding.\n## Issues & Risks\n- The ex-husband has not sold or refinanced his house as required by the divorce decree.\n- Katelynn is uncomfortable with further delays in resolving this issue.\n- Katelynn is concerned about appearing as \"the bad guy\" by taking legal action.\n- There's a risk that the ex-husband might not comply even after legal action.\n## Next steps\n- Sarah will send Katelynn a summary of the options discussed.\n- Sarah will send Katelynn a retainer agreement that's valid for 14 days.\n- Katelynn will consider the options and decide whether to proceed with legal action.\n- If Katelynn decides to proceed, she will contact Sarah's office.\n## Next steps\n- Sarah will send Katelynn a summary of the options discussed.\n- Sarah will send Katelynn a retainer agreement that's valid for 14 days.\n- Katelynn will consider the options and decide whether to proceed with legal action.\n- If Katelynn decides to proceed, she will contact Sarah's office.\n## Questions discussed\n- What are Katelynn's options for legal help?\n- What is the turnaround time for filing a motion to enforce?\n- Would the ex-husband resubmitting a loan assumption application count as complying with the decree?\n- What is the cost of the retainer, and how does billing work?\n- How would the attorneys contact the ex-husband initially?\n## Timeline\n- The divorce decree required both parties to sell or refinance their homes by August of the current year.\n- Filing a motion to enforce would likely result in a hearing in January or February, considering holiday delays.\n- The retainer agreement would be valid for 14 days.\n## Timeline\n- The divorce decree required both parties to sell or refinance their homes by August of the current year.\n- Filing a motion to enforce would likely result in a hearing in January or February, considering holiday delays.\n- The retainer agreement would be valid for 14 days.\n## Outline\n### Discussion on Divorce Decree Compliance\n- Sarah Spitzer explains the return client privilege and the recording of the conversation for note-taking purposes.\n- Katelynn Kuan describes the divorce decree, stating that her ex-husband was supposed to sell or refinance his home by August, while she has sold her part.\n- Katelynn mentions that her ex-husband has attempted to assume the loan once but was denied and is planning to resubmit.\n- Katelynn expresses her discomfort with prolonging the issue and seeks legal advice on how to enforce the divorce decree.\n### Next Steps for Enforcing the Divorce Decree\n- Sarah Spitzer outlines the next steps, including filing a motion to enforce the divorce decree.\n- The motion would require her ex-husband to either sell or refinance the home, with potential contempt charges if he does not comply.\n- The process involves a reply motion from her ex-husband, a hearing in front of a commissioner, and a judicial order.\n- Katelynn inquires about the turnaround time, and Sarah estimates a hearing date in January or February due to holiday constraints.\n### Clarification on Loan Assumption and Legal Options\n- Katelynn asks if her ex-husband's resubmission of the loan assumption application would comply with the decree.\n- Sarah seeks clarification from a colleague, who suggests that assuming the loan might still be a violation of the decree.\n- The colleague proposes an alternative approach of seeking reimbursement for attorney fees without immediately holding her ex-husband in contempt.\n- Sarah emphasizes that this approach could be more amicable and less confrontational.\n### Katelynn's Concerns and Decision-Making Process\n- Katelynn expresses her discomfort with being seen as the \"bad guy\" despite her ex-husband's non-compliance.\n- She requests a summary of the options in writing to discuss with a friend.\n- Sarah offers to send a retainer agreement, explaining the $5,000 fee and the possibility of reimbursement for attorney fees.\n- Katelynn asks about the initial contact method, and Sarah suggests either an email or letter to her ex-husband before proceeding with legal action.\n### Final Decision and Next Steps\n- Katelynn shares her feelings of being too nice and expresses a desire to end the situation once and for all.\n- She acknowledges her ex-husband's ample time to comply and feels a firm approach might be necessary.\n- Katelynn decides to think it over but confirms she needs legal help and will make a decision.\n- Sarah reassures Katelynn, offering to send the call notes and providing her contact information for future communication.\n\n",

After stopping for food, an officer drove erratically, disappeared, and then pulled them over at approximately 1:00 AM. The officer stated that L crossed the white line when going under the bridge. L states that the officer lied to a supervisor about when he turned around and began following them. The officer was driving so close that L could not see his headlights. L believes that they were stopped because they had Washington license plates. The officer stated that he needed to search the vehicle because he noticed a torch lighter in the center console. The officer then stated that he would need to bring the K9 team. At one point, there were 5 officers at the scene; L states they were told that the initiating officer was a rookie who was looking to prove himself. L's daughter left drug paraphernalia in the vehicle, which was subsequently found by officers, along with a spoon with residue.\n\nL was charged with possession of a controlled substance and possession of paraphernalia, Case No. 241800042. L's wife was charged with possession of paraphernalia, Case No. 241800043.\n\nQuoted $5,000 each for representation.\n",
